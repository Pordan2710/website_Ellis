### <font face='Lobster Two'>Hi there!</font>

I'm a postdoctoral fellow in the [biostatistics department](http://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/) at the [JHSPH](http://www.jhsph.edu/), but this Fall, I'll be packing up, leaving Baltimore, and starting as an Assistant Teaching Professor in the [Conitive Science Department](http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/) at [UCSD](https://ucsd.edu/)! 

### <font face='Lobster Two'>My Interests</font>
I love teaching, data science, all things R, pedagogy, genetics, great podcasts, biking, baking, and beach volleyball. I would be *more* than happy to hear from you about any combination of them!
