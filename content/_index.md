Welcome! I'm currently a postdoctoral fellow in the [biostatistics department](http://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/) at the [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](http://www.jhsph.edu/) where I work with all the wonderful people in [Jeff Leek](http://jtleek.com/)'s group. 

This Fall, I'll be packing up, leaving Baltimore, and starting as an Assistant Teaching Professor in the [Conitive Science Department](http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/) at [UCSD](https://ucsd.edu/)!
