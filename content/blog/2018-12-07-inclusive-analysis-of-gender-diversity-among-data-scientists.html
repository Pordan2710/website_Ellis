<p>Abdul Majed Raja recently wrote a <a href="https://datascienceplus.com/gender-diversity-analysis-of-data-science-industry-using-kaggle-survey-dataset-in-r/">nice post</a> analyzing gender diversity within the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/surveys/2017">Kaggle Survey</a> data. This survey, which ran from August 7th to August 25th of 2017, was an “industry-wide survey to establish a comprehensive view of the state of data science and machine learning” with <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/kaggle-survey-2017?">data</a> from 16,716 participants.</p>
<p>Here, I extend Abdul’s work to include responses from participants who did not identify as male or female. This is not a critique of the initial work. I have certainly carried out <a href="https://shanellis.github.io/2016/11/23/LeekGroupColors/">analyses where I’ve excluded the analysis to males and females</a>. However, with 16K+ respondents, I figured this would be a dataset where non-binary individuals could be included. So, I decided to pick up where Abdul left off. As such, I’ve tried to keep the graphs in the same aesthetic as his original post.</p>
<p>Additionally, this work holds the same disclaimer as Abdul’s original post. This dataset certainly is subject to selection bias and is not necessarily representative of all data science practitioners. Nevertheless, when data are there, it is important to look at the data and draw reasonable conclusions with these limitations in mind.</p>

<p>This is where my analysis diverges from Abdul’s. I got curious as to what the gender breakdown analysis would look like indvidiuals who identified as “A different identity” or “Non-binary, genderqueer, or gender non-conforming” included.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>The data include 159 individuals who identify as “A different identity” and 74 who identify as “Non-binary, genderqueer, or gender non-conforming.”</p>
<p>To get a better understanding of how people specifically responded to the gender question, I took a look at the free form responses.</p>

<p>Across the entire data set, there were 134 participants who responded to the free form gender question. Among these, there were 104 unique responses.</p>
<p>Among these responses, it became pretty clear that these were individuals who fell into a few general categories:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>people whose gender identity did not fit into the categories</strong> “female”, “male,” or “nonbinary, genderqueer or gender non-conforming” (i.e. “Bisexual trans nonconformist”, or “Trans female”, or “transhuman”)<br />
</li>
<li>at least 23 people who identify as some sort of <strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/2whf11/what_is_with_the_sexually_identifies_as_an_apache/">apache/attack helicopter</a></strong><br />
</li>
<li>a number of respondents who have <strong>conflated “biological sex” and “gender”</strong><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. (i.e. “There are two genders: MALE/FEMALE. I am sorry, but as I scientist I cannot change reality to make people feel good. I refuse to participate in surveys that deny science.” )<br />
</li>
<li><strong>people who identify as male or female</strong> (free response was some capitalization variant on “male” or “female”) and entered this into the free form box<br />
</li>
<li>Some other <strong>animal</strong> (i.e. “Dolphin”, “kitten”) or <strong>response</strong> (“Jedi”, “Vulcano”, “wtf”, “space marine”, etc.)</li>
</ol>
<p>This suggests that (1) most non-binary and non-cisgender individuals identified as “nonbinary, genderqueer or gender non-conforming”, “male”, or “female” rather than “A different identity” and (2) a gender-inclusive analysis stratified by country and programming language could render some interesting and informative results about the non-binary community among data scientists.</p>

<p>When we look at the entire gender distribution broken down by programming language, we recapitulate previous findings that Python and R are the top two languages used by data scientists. It also appears that more non-binary individuals may use these two languages.</p>

However, looking at the previous plot, this is reflective of the small sample size of F# users (N=4).</p>

<p>If we normalize for the number of participants in each job title, it appears that there are more non-binary individuals with the job title of “Operations Research Practitioner.” However, this again reflects the small number of participants in this job (N=57 across all genders).

<div id="conclusions" class="section level1">
<h1>Conclusions</h1>
<p>The good news is that individuals across the gender spectrum are now able to more accurately identify in survey data. In fact, <a href="http://www.transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/usts/USTS%20Full%20Report%20-%20FINAL%201.6.17.pdf">a 2015 survey</a> to examine the experiences of transgender people in the United States had responses from 27,715 people. However, in data science, as is often the case generally, the conclusions we can draw are limited due to small sample sizes. This suggests that working to be more inclusive as a community will help improve the accuracy of analyses of this type. More importantly, however, improved inclusivity will improve diversity of background and ideas within the field improving the field as a whole.</p>
