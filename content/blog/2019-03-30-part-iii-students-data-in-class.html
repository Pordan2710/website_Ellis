<h1>Background</h1>
<p>This is the third post in a short series about the first course I taught as a new assistant teaching professor at UCSD - COGS 9 : Introduction to Data Science.</p>
<p>To see earlier posts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.shanellis.com/blog/cogs9-introduction-to-data-science/">Part I</a> - discusses what went well &amp; and what went less well</li>
<li><a href="http://www.shanellis.com/blog/part-ii-my-students-thoughts-in-data/">Part II</a> - breaks down what students thought of and learned from the course based on data they provided and how they did in the course.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this post I’ll focus on <strong>how I weaved students data into lecture throughout the course</strong>. The motivation in my having done this is simple - my goal is always to help students engage with the material I’m presenting. And, we humans generally like to learn about ourselves. To help students engage with the material, I did my best to demonstrate the day’s topics with examples using student data. While I used their data in a number of lectures, there are definitely opportunities to expand this to other lectures:</p>

Discussed what this means with regards to data bias and how I could use these results as an instructor for evil (gave students example: what if I only let Asian females come to Office Hours or only wrote them recommendation letters?). For more details, I’ve included my <a href="http://bit.ly/success_prediction">slides</a> from this part of the lecture</td>

<p>The downside here, of course, is that the plots/analysis have to be re-generated each time the course runs, but I think that minimal loss of time is time well spent. But, maybe I’ll ask about this explicitly next time to see if students actually like this aspect of the course and find it useful.</p>
<p>Finally, I include these examples here in case these ideas are helpful to others trying to incorporate student data into their data science classroom. I’m happy to chat more details or share materials about any one of these.</p>
