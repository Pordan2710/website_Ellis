### Chromebook Data Science

[Chromebook Data Science](http://jhudatascience.org/chromebookdatascience/index.html) is a free, online, educational program that sets out to help anyone who can read, write, and use a computer move into the field of data science. We've been developing content and carrying out in-person tutoring to test out and improve this material. Upon official launch, our ultimate goal will be that this program be used as an intervention to improve economic conditions for people both locally in Baltimore and around the world.

### The *recount* project

RNA-seq data for ~70,000 human samples have been aligned using a single analytic pipeline called [Rail-RNA](http://rail.bio/), developed and implemented by [Abhi Nellore](https://twitter.com/AbhiNellore). Spearheaded by [Leo Collado-Torres](http://lcolladotor.github.io/about.html#.WC8mXaIrIdU) and including the efforts of many in our group, these data have been processed and made available in a resource called *[recount](https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/recount/)*. While the expression data are publicly available, we lack critical phenotype information for many of the samples included in this resource. In addition to identifying technical artifacts to be removed across these data, I'm developing phenotype predictors (ie sex, tissue, etc.) from the gene expression data to make important sample information availabe across all samples within recount.
