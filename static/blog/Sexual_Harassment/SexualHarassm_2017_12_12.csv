12/1/2017 15:49:12,"At the beginning of my Ph.D. program, I would stop by the office of a professor whose work I admired. It was my second semester in the program and I was enrolled in his course. As we were talking, he asked me who I was TA-ing for. I told him and he then asked if ""the freshmen boys thought she was attractive?"" I felt blindsided by this question and uncomfortable. I responded with ""Why would I know that?"" I found it creepy, but shook it off as an older man trying to be funny. On another occasion, he lamented to me how the undergraduates now were all too busy on their phones between class instead of ""going back to their dorm rooms to get to know each other better."" He would always pepper our conversations with comments like these which made interacting with him uncomfortable. I was hoping to get some kind of guidance and mentorship as I went through the program since he is recognized name in the field. I never felt like I was taken seriously because of his inappropriate comments. Another time, I was dressed up to give a lecture in a tasteful outfit which included a knee-length pencil skirt and knee-high boots--holdovers from a previous job in an non-profit office setting. He came up to me in a hallway and stood much too close to tell me how ""sexy"" he thought my outfit was and how I should dress like that more often. That was the last time I ever wore a skirt. The rest of the time in the program, I dressed androgynously in jeans and over-sized t-shirts. I also stopped going by his office. Whatever contacts or advice he could have given me was not worth having to listen to his creepy comments about his loneliness or how he'd love to have his female students to his apartment, but ""the bed is much too small."" I felt that he was testing the waters to see if he could get away with more than just saying something questionable. I decided I never wanted to be alone with him, ever. Comparing notes with other females students, I found out he did it to almost every women he encountered, but since he was a decades-long member of the faculty, nothing was ever done about his behavior.He may have received a slap on the wrist about 15 years ago, but that's about all.

Ranking other departmental members by their looks and intelligence, in addition to ranking students in similar ways. Good looks = intelligence.

It's a real ego boost to know that your colleague thinks that your 19 year old students out shine you in the realm of intellectual achievements. 

 One day we were walking down a hallway in a classroom building and a young female student walked by. He turned his head, looked her up and down, and said - Damn, why do they have to be so cute? Couldn't they tone it down to make life easier for us?  

Spoke regularly of the influence he had on my eventual tenure application. ",1st Year Tenure Track Assistant Professor,"Tenured Professor, Senior Professor in Subject Area within department, Designated Departmental ""Mentor""",Other Type of School,,Psychology ,,"After I had been in the department for many months, someone else in the department came to 'check in on me' to let me know that it was generally known that my harasser was a harasser and they wanted to make sure I was okay. They didn't want to make sure he was reported, or that anything was done to stop it, they just wanted me to know they knew that he was an issue and that he had been an issue in the past as well. ?!?!?!? Taking the perspective of an objective outsider, this is horrific. It is institutional support, knowledge and protection of someone who is a serial offender. As the person experiencing the harassment and trying to make sense of it, I actually felt better after the person spoke with me and I learned that ""I wasn't the only one."" At least this let me know that 'it wasn't in my head' and it also made me feel somewhat 'off the hook' about whether or not I had a responsibility to report the behaviour. My main concern before had been whether this person was treating other people this way as well or potentially treating the students in the same way. I was worried that somehow I was the only one with this information and that if I didn't tell anyone I would be complicit in whatever other 'bad deeds' he was committing on campus. It sounds ridiculous to actually type this out, but knowing that the department and the administration already knew that this person was a predator took the weight off of me, and therefore made me feel better. It also made me angry. Why did they leave me be for so many months? Why wasn't I warned immediately? And really, why is this person employed at the university? This last question though, seems almost silly. We all know the reasons why. Instead of making a fuss or trying to prove a case, they just sit back and hope that he will retire. The women in the department take on additional students in order to avoid the potential situation of having a known predator serve as a student's primary supervisor. The women in the department teach overloads, have classes filled past the cap because one of the senior, tenured professors is a known predator and therefore cannot be trusted with upper level courses. Honestly, if you cannot trust someone with a room of 20 young girls, why can you trust them with a room of 90 young girls? ","None. He is biding his time, pulling in a full professor salary at the top of the grid waiting until it is absolutely necessary to retire. He doesn't have to do research, he doesn't have to supervise students (because they're worried about how he'll interact with them if he does), he doesn't have to teach new courses. He has a great job. ","Too soon to tell. I haven't quit yet. I tend to not go to my office very much. I work mostly from home whenever possible. I began doing this so as to avoid his visits to my office. Eventually, it seemed to work. When I do go to my office now, he doesn't seem to come knocking. However, I continue to go rather irregularly, so for all I know, he does still come knocking and I am just not there to answer. In the long run, this could have a negative impact on my career if it has created the impression that I am not around. I know that they tell tenure track people to ""look busy"" and to ""be seen."" I've basically done the opposite in an attempt to avoid him as much as possible. Luckily, I think that my track record on paper will make up for this, as there's very little else to find fault with me on other than the amount of time I spend in my office vs. working from other locations. ","Starting a new tenure track position is known to be stressful, but honestly, it was this harassment that made the beginning of my position as a professor the most stressful and the most upsetting. I wrote 3 grants in my first year, taught an overload, and published 5 manuscripts. I did not find any of that stressful - I enjoyed my work. What kept me up at nights, what brought me to tears, and what made me hide from my office was the stress and discomfort of wondering what to do about the sexual harassment I was experiencing. Teaching 3 new courses, teaching for the first time ever, writing grants, continuing my research - none of that brought me to tears in my first year. The only thing that brought me to tears was my experiences with this one individual - who was supposedly doing all that he could to 'help' me. ",The experience really burst my bubble. I honestly believed that the trope of the 'old creepy male professor' was a thing of the past. I never in my life expected that I would come face to face with the cold reality that this still takes place. It has tarnished what should have been the most exciting part of my career up to this point. ,"Good idea. the Chronicle of HE seems to be collecting similar info, but you have better questions  - so I filled yours out but not theirs.

One of the coordinators of the conference, after setting up, suggested we all go eat. So we did and the conference’s organization paid for the dinner and the very expensive wine. The second bottle of wine wasn’t finished by the group and so the organizer took it back with him saying he didn't want to waste good wine. That night, the conference organizer in question sent me a text (he had all the volunteer numbers) suggesting that “this bottle of wine wasn’t going to drink itself.” I remember feeling immense fear but I ignored the text, locked my door, and said the next day that I had put my phone on “do not disturb.” The next day, I was invited to dinner by a prominent scholar that I wanted to talk to about her work. To my surprise, several people, including the conference organizer were invited also.

Also in these meetings, I would catch him looking at my chest, thighs, and other body parts in a sexualized way before averting his eyes. He told me inappropriate things about his childhood and tried to insert topics like incest into our conversations, perhaps because he had read my sexual abuse into my poetry or because he knew I was pursuing a Title IX case. He would constantly try to bring up my father or compare himself to my father (i.e. ""I know I'm not your dad, but I'm really proud of you""). He would constantly compare me to his girlfriend, later wife, and set up a meeting between us for unknown reasons. He seemed thrilled that it had gone well.

Later, the professor shared with me the unofficial guide to grad school that he gave all hopeful MFAs. One of the pieces of advice was that ""some professors may prefer to meet over wine."" Also in the guide was a recommendation that students attend a popular writing conference so that they could ""have consensual sex with other writers ;).""

The young woman who found the essay left the university the following year.

","As I mentioned above, I was angry at myself for not paying closer attention to what younger women faculty were experiencing.  I don't think the department chair was intentionally harassing, it was more thoughtless than anything.  But his career was marked with several incidents where he showed poor judgement and made unprofessional comments.  I should have been more proactive, knowing this.

This particular graduate student was one of the first I worked with as a TA and as such I respected and trusted him. He was also married, had children, and was serving as a graduate representative for our program. I was referred to him several times over the years by professors as someone who could offer feedback on my research. The second incident was a graduate student who in the cohort that came in two years later, we had known each other in undergrad as well, he was just embarking on coursework.",Other R1,Stony Brook University,Comparative Literature and Cultural Studies,,"I never reported it, having heard stories from other women in the department about the stress of reporting to the graduate school, the burden of proof placed on the victim, and the refusal by the institution to deal with the situation.","None (but to be fair, I never reported the incident).",None so far other than some feelings of no longer feeling comfortable in my workplace.,"It definitely increased my stress. For a while I was angry, I hated that graduate candidate. I was surprised to find that those closest to me in my personal life (my family and significant other) were quick to blame me. ""What were you doing in a bar with this guy?"" Well, obviously I was at a graduate student happy hour, but unfortunately circumstances that evening left an opening when one student (who later said he had made her uncomfortable as well) suddenly rushed out of the event, the other remaining graduate student went to check on her, and this left a window of time where my colleague and I were left alone at the table. I think of the people in my support network I told, only two immediately said what had happened to me was wrong, and that this male graduate student had taken advantage of the situation. Everyone else either blamed me, or said ""well, he's under a lot of pressure, it's probably just an isolated incident, you should just forgive him."" It hurt to feel the lack of support, and probably the biggest thing this student's actions revealed to me were the limitations of my own relationships, THAT was the hardest, for example, to hear my mom say ""what were you doing alone in a bar with this graduate student?"" I think she realized later that she was victim blaming but, I'll never forget that she never really apologized to me for victim blaming. At least my boyfriend at the time apologized for his initial victim blaming response, but you want your parents to understand. Ultimately, I think I recovered quickly 1. because the incident stopped at verbal harassment and 2. as an underrepresented minority you get used to blocking out the demeaning or upsetting things people say and use that discrimination to fuel your drive rather than letting it become a distraction. I made up my mind after that incident that, since he would likely not be impacted at all, I wasn't going to let him impact my career trajectory, and I wanted to take the time I would spend seeking institutional support, and instead funnel it into my research. I am privileged to be in a field where I did not need to interact with this guy regularly because the humanities aren't as collaborative as some other fields. Nevertheless, I'll probably never enter another department with the level of trust and belief in my colleagues that I came to this institution with, probably a good thing because as the news seems to be proving this is the reality we live in, and sexual harassment is a large part of it. It definitely saddens me to feel the burden of always being suspicious and self-protecting, but I feel like it's up to me to guard my mental health because large institutions like Universities are looking at liability management not the good of its population.","It didn't change much. Like I said, in the humanities our work is done in a more isolated environment, and luckily this graduate student wanted to graduate and leave academia, so I likely won't encounter him again. If anything, it probably increased my empathy towards others to have experienced how powerless one feels in the face of workplace sexual harassment. The harassment made me more determined to succeed in my career because I don't think it was really about sexual desire, I think this graduate student felt threatened by his female colleagues and was acting out (because a number of female graduate students and candidates, and even female students who had graduated with their Ph.D. shared stories with me or friends who told them my story about this guy making them uncomfortable, making unwanted physical contact, stuff like that) and I want to show, you can't frighten off your competitors that way, so I'll keep going, and hopefully one day I'll be in a position to advocate for change in how sexual harassment at the University is handled. The sad part is probably, all of us have given this guy the benefit of the doubt only to discover later just how many of us there were. ","Even now, part of me doesn't want to submit this information. I feel ashamed that I just let it pass, and that shame makes me want to continue to bottle up the incident because I didn't step forward.",Male

12/2/2017 12:51:11,"Jan 20, 2008 I was in a shared graduate student office late at night, I asked a fellow grad student if he would be staying late and, if so, if he could walk me to my bike otherwise I would leave early. He said he was planning to stay late and agreed to walk me to my bike. These are my notes from the incident: 

I finished reading a little after 10pm and as I started packing up * sparked up a conversation about his loneliness and his relationship status. He confessed that he was reading a self-help book about relationships because he felt really lonely and couldn’t figure out how to meet someone. He mentioned that in the book he was reading the author said that women immediately knew whether or not they would sleep with a man upon meeting him. He then proceeded to ask me about my relationships. He asked me if I had ever had a one night stand and I said no. He said he couldn’t believe it and said that he had slept with a lot of virgins—that these young women would pick him out, in a club, for example, and ask to sleep with him. I told him I found it odd and unbelievable. I can’t recall the exact details of the conversation at this point, but I do know that as he continued to ask me about my relationships and the role that sex played in my relationships.

At one point * suddenly asked me “Do you want to fuck?” 
I said “No, I would never sleep with you.” 
He said “Well, when I look at you I want to fuck you. When you look at me do you want to fuck me?”
I repeated myself, “No, I would never sleep with you.”
He acted shocked. 
He told me something along the lines of “I can fuck for hours.” 
He also told me that his room was nearby. 
I told him “You’re being really creepy ***,” because by this point the entire tone of the conversation had changed dramatically, and I was startled and afraid.  Although he denied that he was acting creepy, I repeated myself. I called his behavior creepy at least 4 times and he asked me to stop saying it. He said something like “That’s the kind of thing you say about criminals” (he might have said “…about a molester” I can’t remember exactly). He was visibly upset by my comment.

As I was sitting down printing, *** positioned himself standing behind me and asked me “What kind of panties are you wearing?” 
I told him to stop, and that he was really creeping me out. 

I was really afraid that I was alone with him and I would have to walk outside to get my bike and that he might hurt me. In an effort to direct the conversation, once again, toward his inappropriate behavior, I started a conversation about how he related to woman in the history department. I told him that I thought he had problems communicating with women and that other women in the department had mentioned as much. I told him that a couple of women had complained to me that he didn’t acknowledge them or say hello, and that in this instance, when he was actually talking to one of his female colleagues, his behavior had become inappropriate very quickly. He got defensive again and told me that he always tried to be very objective and that he wanted people to think of him as such, and that perhaps he was misunderstood. I told him that, on the contrary, he wasn’t objective at all; that he was one of the most dogmatic people I knew and that other people in the department might agree with me. At this point we were walking outside and I had already picked up my bike. He told me that the reason he didn’t acknowledge women or even say hello to them was because his aunt had told him that, as a man, any little thing you do—even looking at a woman the wrong way—might be misinterpreted as sexual harassment. 

I discovered that another female graduate student had also been sexually harassed by *** who had been assigned as her mentor in the department. We met with our mutual adviser and with the head of the department to report our experiences. ",graduate student,graduate student,Other R1,University of Arizona,history,,The head of the history department said the university had invested so much in him that they would not jeopardize his career based on what would appear to university lawyers as hearsay at best and defamation of character at worst. Because the incident occurred in our share graduate student office they moved him into his own office. My adviser fought to include in his file something about the fact that he had been accused of sexual harassment by two female graduate students. (It turned out that an undergraduate student had also complained about him but due to privacy issues no one shared the details.),"None that I can see, according to his online profile he's currently an Assistant Professor of History at the American University in Dubai ","I don't know, it took me a long time finish my MA, which might have been a function of many things that had nothing to do with the harasser. One striking aspect of the whole thing is that when he and I took historiography together, the male professor of the course I asked me to take it easy on him because I routinely challenged his interpretation of the readings. I developed an understanding that he was in a profession invested in protecting him and his career. I did go on to complete my PhD a different institution and currently have a post-doc. I hope to land a tenure track job but I will not be surprised if I don't and if he continues to succeed. ",,,,Male

This now former professor has been able to bury the case and tell others that he did not know this undergraduate sexual partner was his bio-daughter and/or that it is entirely fabricated. When the case broke it was only picked up by the alt-right press, Rush Limbaugh, etc., but it was not followed up by the New York Times or other legitimate media outlets, perhaps because this professor was well connected, and the few of us who knew what happened did not want to cause more hurt for his relations--the daughter, the mother of the daughter, his wife, his other children, his parents and family. He also enjoyed the lucky break that the bio daughter had a different last name than his--his name is not on her birth certificate.  What was the upshot? it took years for his department (different department than mine) to let him go. What happened to the daughter, her bio-mother, and her extended family was devastating. I am reporting this because it was completely totally buried and had a traumatic impact on many who have had to work with this man. This Ivy is notorious for sexual harassment;  friends and colleagues have identified their rapists on the faculty, but nothing is done. This professor may have faced more serious ramifications--when the Manhattan DA charged him, he agreed to a misdemeanor plea and eventually was removed from the faculty. The willingness of others to believe that he was an innocent or ignore it is appalling. I am reporting this because this level of sexual impropriety/harassment/assault (whatever you would choose to call it) happens in large part because others are ultimately complicit.

I thought that it would be a dinner with several people, but when I got there, he and I were the only guests. We had dinner, and then afterward, he went into a back room and came back out in his bathrobe. I quickly got up, let him know that this could never happen again and walked out the front door. In retrospect, I feel terrible that I didn't actually report this. It was more than twenty-five years ago, and I know he was doing similar things to other people, but I felt that I handled it on my own. I never received any retribution from him, and I was always a very strong person. But I also understand that many others were more vulnerable than I, and in at least one case, I know that he engaged in retribution toward a student with whom he slept.

","In the end, I don't think it did have any impact on my career. I kept my distance from him. He signed off on my dissertation and wrote letters for my job search. At one point a colleague warned me not to ask for letters from him any more, not because he said anything bad, but because the letters he did write for me were so sloppy and incomprehensible. ","Initially, I was s creeped out. I went immediately over to my boyfriend's (now my husband) house after it happened, because I needed to talk about it with someone close to me. In the end, it just made me keep him at arm's length. I was luckily headed to a fellowship that took me to another country, so I did not have any contact with him at all for a year and a half after that, until I came back. By then he was embroiled in the aftermath of the sexual harassment suit I mentioned above. I had little contact with him other than responding to comments from him on my dissertation. ","It did not derail me in any way. But it certainly made me militant about keeping a clear distance between me and my own graduate students. I have a strict code about it, and judge my colleagues pretty harshly if I feel that they have stepped over the line in any way. In one of the institutions where I taught, an assistant professor moved in with an undergraduate student. He had been let go after his third year review, and I did not find out about this relationship until after he had already gone.

Until that point, I'd thought of him as a father figure, and I felt completely betrayed. I tried to laugh it off at first, but then I realized how many other students believed the rumors, and so I withdrew from social events and stopped engaging in class. ",None. ,"A number of people in my MFA program were convinced because of the public (and very, very graphic) nature of my mentor's comments that I was sleeping with him, and the gossip spread. It was a particularly bad - and totally false - rumor because he was married at the time (they later divorced, and he subsequently established a pattern of sleeping with very young female graduate students - a new one every year). I was engaged, but my fiancee thankfully trusted me and put no stock in it. I was mortified. It affected my writing for years; for a time, I stopped completely. I felt I had no recourse because it was his word against mine, and he was a very well-known writer. It made me feel completely helpless. I didn't think anyone would believe me. Even now, even given his reputation, there are still people from my MFA program who believe I was having an affair with him, and some who believe that I was the one who broke up his marriage. ","Severe anxiety. Severe damage to my faith in my abilities as a writer - I believed, and still believe, that the compliments he gave about my writing were simply because he wanted to sleep with me. I now have faith in my abilities, but I don't believe for a second that he was doing anything but grooming me. ","I've mostly recovered. I've made a career as a writer and eventually returned to school to earn my PhD, but I am years behind where I would be if he hadn't embarrassed me, undermined me, and messed with my head. The funny thing is, when I reached out to him once when I was still upset and confused and seeking affirmation and an apology, he refused to even respond. It's given me a lot of clarity about the quality of person that he is - which is, of course, completely despicable. ","MFA programs in particular are rife with this kind of misogyny and abuse - I have heard stories from virtually every woman I know who graduated from an MFA program who experienced something like this (plus I'm white, and the stories that I've heard from my friends who are WOC make mine seem tame in comparison). White male writers in particular have egos the size of the Eastern seaboard, and their sense of entitlement to sexual gratification from their female students knows no bounds. Someone needs to do an objective assessment of MFA program dynamics, especially those programs (too many) that are still populated primarily by white male faculty. Those men need to be made to account for their behavior publicly the same way they've dragged the names and reputations of their female graduate students through the mud. And then they need to be put out on their asses and banned from the academy for good. ",Male
12/2/2017 21:37:31,"While in my surgical training, an attending physician broke a valuable instrument. I was called into the department chief who accused me of breaking it. I said I had not. He replied, “Well, you were the only woman there.” I understood I was to take the blame —and ridicule—for the damage. I had to have a second (male) student, of the same or lower rank on the team, present to make sure the replacement instrument was properly used. This, I later learned, was the Dean’s requirement for  purchasing the replacement. For two more years I took on the reluctance of other trainees to team up with my “fumble-fingers.” It even followed me as I pursued post-doc training, as the surgical staff were reluctant to recommend me, based on this false rumor. When I went to the department chair, sweating and vomiting for days before doing so, I literally begged him to recommend me to a very inferior post-doc position. He agreed to do so, with a sense of enormous  magnanimity. I literally kissed him for doing so, I was so relieved. Later I learned he had told the program chief that accepted me that I had been described as someone who could “take one for the team.” The accepting director told me later that this was conveyed in a way that implied I was willing to “do antything” to get ahead. This made the program director think I was being passed over by better programs due to lack of skill, that I was only be promoted due to sexual favors. So when I arrived at my post-doc the reception was guarded until  I could (over)prove my skills. I received what I thought were an unusual amount of sexual suggestions from my post doc faculty until the director finally  told me how I had been presented to him by my former chief.

They more or less ignored me and pretended not to notice the groping.

12/3/2017 11:56:24,"I was applying for PhD programs two years ago and met with a potential advisor. He is at Stanford and I live in Davis, so we were going to meet in San Francisco as a half-way point--he also lives in the city so it wasn't an inconvenience. I was very naïve and only halfway done with my M.A. when I emailed him and I figured we would skype or chat on the phone, but he was pretty insistent we meet in person. He kept changing the time and place where we would meet and it ended up being at 9 PM at night at an Irish Pub in the Mission District of SF on a Saturday night. He then proceeded to buy drinks for both of us and ignore my attempts to remind him I needed to catch BART and then catch Amtrak in the East Bay to go back to Davis that night. I basically had to stand up and say I couldn't have another drink (after being pressured to drink the first one, a large Guinness) and needed to catch BART. He then walked me to the BART station, hand on the small of my back, asking me whether I wouldn't rather stay in the city or get a ride to a different BART station. I said no and beelined for the closest station. He walked with me the whole way and then hugged me for far too long and far too much hand-moving around my back. This was before I'd even submitted my application and I felt so gross after the incident that I could barely bring myself to put in effort to my application--what was the point? Even if I got in to my dream school, I'd probably be sexually assaulted and harassed for years. I had to endure a skype interview with him and four of his colleagues (all older, white men) a couple months after this, which went terribly and after which I had a panic attack. I had been sexually assaulted two years prior to the inappropriate ""meeting"" in the Mission and it was triggering for me, in addition to being damaging to my career aspirations and self confidence. Shortly after this event, I then received an invitation from UC Santa Barbara to visit campus after submitting my PhD application, which I took as a promising sign. I found out on my trip that my potential advisor, who had been very encouraging about my application, was on leave (and had been for the duration of my application cycle) and was being investigated for sexual harassment towards female graduate students. I had to learn this through some of the current grad students--no one on the faculty or staff told me, even though I met individually with several of them. Not even his wife, who also works in the department and was listed as a potential advisor on my application as well, even suggested that he might not be able to even take on any grad students for the upcoming cycle. Only two students ended up going to UCSB that cycle for this grad program--the annual average is between 9 and 11. So two of my most promising PhD opportunities were completely ruined before I even got to consider an offer.

12/3/2017 11:56:45,"From day one of being hired, I was pursued sexually by my department chair. I was 30, he was 55. He would openly announce his attraction to me in front of students and colleagues. He would openly in front of others express his love for me, describing that he felt about me the same love and attraction as he did for his wife when he first met her. Seeing me, even from afar, would lead to his coming my way to hug me, compliment my looks, my attire, my smile. He would refer to me as his very own Greek goddess. He would call me to meetings in his office to tell me his personal problems and seek my care of him, which when I did not give, made me pursue me all the more fiercely. He declared he needed to be a student in my class to learn from me, and attended every class session for my first semester. He would challenge most everything I said in class. After class, he would stand with his groin in my face as I sat in a deskchair talking with students after class. He would block me from getting out of the chair, so that he could keep his dick close to my mouth. One time as I was bending over to pick up my bag, he ran to the front of the room to put his dick in my face so that when I stood up, my face made contact with his entire crotch. I reported each incident to colleagues and my Dean. I was told to ignore him, as he is mentally ill. I was told he is harmless and that I should laugh it off. I was told that nothing he did was really going to harm my professional development because I was so smart and capable of rising above. When I continued to demand an end to his contact with me, and secured a lawyer, the institution finally put in writing that he is not to be my department chair any  more, that he is to stop attending my class, that he is to have no contact with me, that he is not to address me. All this triggered his fury and his behavior became dangerous. He announced to students that he was divorcing me, and posted a sign on his door that because of my hostility towards him, and University invasiveness, that his liberties are being taken away. Students would laugh and joke about it in front of me. They would tease me to take him back because he was so brokenhearted. They reported he would take up regular class time describing his anger towards me as the divorce proceeded. He made regular derogatory comments about me and anything I contributed as an idea during faculty meetings. He wrote a private letter for my tenure file that was later described to me by members of the t & p committee as pages long, filled with hateful descriptions of my incompetence, and that ""couldn't have been crazier if it had been written in crayon."" Private letters were eliminated from tenure review processes shortly after this episode. The harassment lasted a total of six years, until he was took an early retirement option.  Some of my colleagues to this day who supported him are hostile to me for being so cruel to their ""kindly colleague"" who ""suffered from mental illness.""

I had to allow his participation in my tenure review. Knowing he had access to all my private information, letters of research, teaching, and service evaluation I would never be able to read, that his voice was part of private deliberations about me, etc. had a devastating effect on my mental health. I did not have a nervous breakdown, but that is only because of my twice a week therapy and years of heavy medication to get myself through the experience. I had no support from colleagues.

Those 6 years of harassment shaped the course of my life and my mental health.,"I am a work-a-holic, and once I got tenure I became a fierce protector and defender of others in the academy who are subject to sexual harassment. I do not allow anyone to feel isolated and alone as I did. Every new woman who enters our University is welcomed by me, and I open up channels for conversation as they navigate their experiences. Each new colleague I mentor in this way eventually shares her own story of harassment with me. Not one has been free of it. NOT ONE. Some have left the institution because of it. Some have left academia because of it. Some have stayed and join the fight with me. I fight every day, and this fight attitude has shaped my personality, my mental health, and my physical health. I am plagued by exhaustion and fury.  I am quite successful at fighting though, so I continue, and I try to learn how to gather around me the life resources I need to support my work on behalf of others. I suffer now from a malady of health concerns, including a weak heart valve/murmur, chronic anxiety, and compromised digestion (I cannot eat most foods, and live mainly on a liquid diet). I am learning to heal, using acupuncture, yoga, meditation, in combination with therapy. I'm not sure I'll ever be free from this plague. ","For so many years, I had to suffer this all in isolation.

12/3/2017 11:59:39,I received an inappropriate series of emails from a senior college in my department.,untenured Assistant Professor,Emeritus Professor in my department.,Elite Institution/Ivy League,,Political Science,,"I reported to my chair, who reported to the university's EEOC office.  This happened twice, as the harassment started again a year after the initial reprimand.","He was banned from the department for several months after the second reported incident.  My chair also took away his office.  He's now allowed back on campus and is around all the time, even though he has nowhere to go.","The initial report was filed two weeks before my tenure case came before my department.  While my harasser was not a voting member of the department, I later learned that his two closest colleagues (who worked in a suite with him) were the only two 'no' votes on my tenure case and one of them packed the meeting notes with terrible comments on my work and research.  I was ultimately denied tenure.  While I can't prove a connection, I have my suspicions.  When I went back on the market, at one of my job interviews, the chair of the department let me know that my harasser was one of his closest friends in the discipline.  Unsurprisingly, I didn't get that job. ","It was extremely stressful for me.  My chair was supportive and did the right thing, but I struggled at work.  When my harasser was allowed back on campus, he would lurk around my office for hours, making it difficult for me to feel like I could leave my door open or even leave my office.  Even though my chair kept watch over him and helped as much as he could, I never felt safe.  In hindsight, it really aggravates me that I, a professional woman with an excellent research profile and award-winning teaching, had to leave my place of employment.  Meanwhile, a retired man (with what I later learned was a history of harassment at multiple institutions) is still free to roam about.","I feel very lucky.  I got a new job in a much better department in a better location, and my colleagues behave appropriately here.

12/3/2017 12:07:32,"I was working abroad, and was in the process of applying to graduate programs. On the recommendation of a mentor, I reached out to some scholars in my field who were in the same city and asked for informational interviews. After one such meeting a coffee shop, one scholar and I split a cab because we were headed in the same direction and it would be expensive separately since it was quite far. When we got in he sat in the middle, directly beside me, even though we were the only two in the back of the taxi. He put his hand on mine, and when I pulled it away, he then put it on my knee. I leaned as far as a possible against the window, and when he asked why I was sitting like that I said my back and neck hurt. He offered to give me a neck massage, which I declined politely. He started to nuzzle my neck with his face  and asked if a kiss would make it feel better. Again I said no thank you and stared determinedly out the window. Thankfully by this point we arrived at his destination. He paid his portion of the ride and got out. The cab took me home and I didn't leave the house for three days. At first I didn't tell my husband, who I had mentioned repeatedly to the scholar in small talk in the cab in an effort to give him a clearer hint. If my disinterest wasn't enough, I thought maybe I could rely on patriarchal norms and hope that he'd at least respect another man's ""claim"" on me. I was wrong. The patriarchy always screws you over. Within a week I did tell my husband, who offered what comfort assurances he could from across an ocean. I've since only told 4 other people- 2 of whom I told only AFTER they shared their own harassment experiences by the exact same scholar.

I simply got the hell out of that situation.  I recognize that this isn't an option for everyone and that not every aggressor takes the hint. At the time I was employed by a female professor from my undergraduate institution. She was and is a great mentor of mine. In ways I didn't quite acknowledge at the time, having a strong female role model who actively supported my academic goals allowed me to remove myself from a toxic situation. The job she gave me allowed me to earn money so the extra time it took me to switch advisors and finish my degree was less of a hardship, but I also lived in the knowledge that I could let one potential advocate for my graduate career go and that there was still someone behind me. "," I worked in the service industry for many years which and the unfortunate effect of raising my bar for harassment to really be assault, which is to say, it was fairly par for the course after many years of tending bar and cocktail waitressing. I rolled my eyes, complained to one or two friends and moved on. Its a bad sad to be so anesthetized.  I was also 27 or 28 and had, as I mention above, other sources of institutional support. I didn't much internalize his objectification. I figured he was a sleaze. I suspect this person could and has done more damage to people in more vulnerable positions than I was in at the time. I regret not saying anything for their sake.  ","It did delay completion of my masters degree because I had to seek a new advisor. I continued to work with him for awhile after that particular incident but my distrust for him made it hard to overcome natural hurdles in a mentor/mentee relationship. I went on from that Masters program to enter a PhD program at an elite university. This and other incidents in my past have shaped my attitude toward choosing people to partner with. I won't have anything to do with any professors who give off even a whiff of flirtatious energy. I'm just not interested in dealing with it. This can be quite limiting. Even now I am in a position where someone I find potentially questionable in the way he speaks to female colleagues has been promoted to an administrative position in the Research Center that gave me the fellowship I am presently on. Building a relationship with him could really help me as I look for work beyond my funded years, but, even if he is only a little flirty and dismissive of the accomplishments of the women in his field, I can't play along, I can't disguise my contempt, so I just keep away.

12/3/2017 14:06:57,"During the first year of my graduate program, I separated from my emotionally abusive husband and entered into a new romantic relationship with a fellow graduate student. I am a relatively private person, and as such, kept many of the details to myself as a way of coping with my impending divorce and continued emotional coercion and abuse from my husband. During that time, the fellow graduate students in my cohort (both male and female) bombarded me with questions about my separation and my new relationship, including intimate, detailed questions about my sex life. When I politely declined to share this information, members of my cohort spread malicious, speculative rumors about my sexual history and the current state of my sex life. These rumors not only circulated among graduate students, but also spread to members of faculty, including the professor I worked for as an R.A. Two male graduate students contacted my estranged husband to fill him on the rumors they had heard about my sex life, sparking an escalation of my husband's continued threats and abuse. The professor I worked for an an R.A. approached the graduate student I was then in a relationship with to admonish my partner for entering into a relationship with a ""married woman."" During admitted students weekend, rumors about my sex life were also spread to many of the prospective graduate students who came to visit the campus. Needless to say, my reputation as a slut, alongside detailed and highly exaggerated if not outright false rumors of my sex life persisted throughout the rest of my time in the program. New graduate students I'd never met approached me while drunk to say that they'd heard I was into ""threesomes"" or that they'd been warned off from talking to me because I might try to ""break up"" their relationships. After being given a desirable teaching assignment by our course coordinator, I found out the director of my graduate program had chosen to strip both me and my partner from teaching the advanced course. When I approached the director to ask why we had both been demoted in terms of teaching assignments, the professor claimed that she'd made the decision based on our relationship status. Needless to say, the explanation made no sense and was beyond unprofessional and inappropriate. Just before graduating from the program, I discovered that this same professor had, at one point, invited fellow graduate students over to her house, at which time she had engaged in spreading false rumors about me that she had heard from former students. When I again approached this professor about her unprofessional behavior, she claimed that she was not responsible for verifying rumors before discussing them with my fellow graduate students. ",Graduate Student,"Fellow graduate students, professor in charge of R.A.ship, director of graduate program",R2,University of Alabama,Creative Writing,,"Before I graduated from the program, I did speak to the new director of the program to make sure the issue was known. She was kind and sympathetic, and offered to address the complaint formally with the old director of our program. While I spoke to individual professors and students before then, I had not filed an official complaint, in part because I did not know doing so was possible and I feared even more retaliation on the part of fellow graduate students and faculty. ",None that I know of,"After my first semester in my graduate program, I mostly withdrew from any program activities outside of classes. When I did go to department sponsored events, I often felt uncomfortable and ostracized. I didn't apply for any additional department awards, jobs, or positions because I didn't think I'd actually be considered for them (in part due to persistent rumors at both the student and faculty level, in part due to the way I'd been demoted in terms of course assignments by the head of the program). I also failed to network with fellow graduate students. I still live with the persistent fear that rumors will circulate when I go on the job market in the future as some my former harassers are still very involved in the field. ","Untold. I essentially isolated myself for the duration of my program. I had very few friends. When I tried to address the issue of the rumors and harassment with my fellow graduate students early on, I was either given the cold shoulder or told I deserved what was happening to me. People I'd once considered my friends were willing to ruin my reputation and experience in the program because I wouldn't be forthcoming about my divorce or sex life with them. The impact of dealing with all of this while also attempting to get a divorce from an abusive husband was, frankly, devastating. I spent a lot of time crying. On a daily basis, I felt an exorbitant amount of anxiety and stress knowing that I would still have to interact with these students and professors both inside and outside of class. I still spend hours contemplating how things could have been different. I routinely blame myself. At times, the entire experience feels so shameful as to be unspeakable. I fear rumors will persist as I am still within the academic community alongside several of my harassers. I feel like I have to be the perfect student and the perfect colleague lest anyone in my current graduate program ever catch wind of old rumors and the cycle of harassment begins again. ","I trust people less. I do not submit to publications my harassers are associated with and also avoid going to large group conferences that I know my harassers will likely attend. I am wary of networking, as many colleagues I meet already know my harassers through social media and may even be friendly with them.

I have Hershey's Kisses in my office and he kept asking if he could have a kiss, but kept saying it in a creepy way and then made suggestive comments about it afterward.

Instance 1) An major figure in the field came to give a talk on campus when I was an undergraduate student (not even 20 years old) and was lured up to the man's hotel room with the promise of a signed copy of his book as a thank you for driving him around during the day as we hosted him.

His colleagues consistently look the other way and play dumb.

Instance 2)  Predatory faculty member was dating graduate and undergraduate students. It was an open secret, except to those targeted by professor. Others did not warn students or punish faculty member. 

Instance 3) Also occured when I was in graduate school. I took an undergraduate class in my subfield on an interesting topic, and the professor made sexually inappropriate comments all semester long. His girlfriend came to a class film screening and he said he hoped we didn't mind if her head was in his lap during the movie.

During my second year as a faculty member he took umbrage to a concern I raised in a faculty email chain and stopped talking to me.

12/3/2017 16:59:33,"My final year of graduate school I--a queer woman of color--was getting strong flirtatious signals from a faculty member--also a queer woman of color. This was someone who I had been attracted to for several years but I never, ever entertained the idea of having a crush on her, let alone pursuing a relationship with her. At first I thought it was all in my head: “there’s no way that this woman is flirting with me, am I insane?” (In hindsight, I can now see how head games were a central component of the manipulation that would follow). I had had a particularly rough few years in graduate school, which included an antagonistic working relationship with one of my committee members and messy boundaries between myself and my dissertation advisor (who I frequently offered emotional and logistical support to as she endured a personal crisis of her own). I think that the dynamics I had with these two other faculty members contributed to me being in an unusually precarious and vulnerable position as a grad student, which is why I found it exciting and flattering to have a faculty member shower positive, flirtatious attention on me. 

I somehow got it in my head that I should ask her out on a date. To my surprise, she said yes. And that was the start of what would turn out to be an extremely tumultuous relationship that lasted about a year, followed by another year of emotional abuse. While the relationship started out great, magical even, it quickly became volatile and emotionally abusive. It would take me a long time to connect the dots and realize that I might have been preyed upon. For example, long after the relationship ended I was looking at an old text message exchange we had before we had even gone out on our first date. In the text exchange she mentioned that she was trying to ease her conscience by reviewing every email she had ever sent me (before I asked her out). Naive as I was, I asked why she would do that. She replied by saying that she was trying to see if she had been unprofessional at any point (i.e. if there had been any written evidence of her flirtation). She concluded that the emails showed that she had just been warm and supportive, and proclaimed: ""So it’s on you.” Later on I would learn that I was not the first student that she had had a relationship with. She had dated another student at a previous institution. And the MO was the same: he had asked her out. I suppose “it” (the responsibility? the transgression?) was on him, too…

After a tumultuous year-long affair, she broke up with me and I was utterly heartbroken. This also coincided with me taking a postdoc on the other side of the country, which has lead me to endlessly wonder: did she dump me because the relationship was toxic and that was the benevolent thing to do? Or did she dump me because I wasn’t willing to sacrifice my career so that I could stay near her? There was a brief attempt to rekindle things long distance, until out of nowhere she ghosted on me.  At the same time, her phone would (mysteriously, conveniently) butt dial me every week for about 2 months. When I confronted her about it in a text message, she gaslit me and tore me a new one. This is just one example of the kind of catch-and-release manipulation that characterized our interactions. ",ABD and in my final year,"Faculty member and had just been granted tenure. But did not serve in any direct position of power over me (i.e. was not on my committee, I never took a class with her, etc.). ",Other R1,,Humanities ,,n/a,Unknown,"This person has made things difficult for me at professional conferences that we both attend. For example, shortly after the ghosting/gaslighting/tearing of a new one, I was attending a major conference and talking with two junior colleagues/peers when she approached our group and began to loudly and enthusiastically engage with both of my colleagues while completely ignoring me. It made me feel small and invisible. I was so uncomfortable and upset by this that I excused myself and abruptly left the scene. She proceeded to do something similar at another conference we both attended several months later. This behavior feels territorial and like she is trying to bully me out of the way. ","This relationship and its aftermath have been extremely damaging to my mental health. She said and did things that not only crushed my spirits and messed with my head, but also crushed my intellectual and professional confidence. It’s basically been the equivalent of pouring gasoline on the imposter complex flames. I really thought she loved me. And maybe she did. But in the end, love doesn’t matter. What matters is respect, and she demonstrated over and over again that she had none for me. ", I am currently in a contingent position and on the job market (again). I oscillate between wanting to drop out and leave academe (which she would sometimes subtly suggest I should do) and wanting to get a prestigious tenure track job at an elite R1 as part of my desire to prove her wrong about all the negative things she said about me. Outcome still TBD. ,"I have spent months obsessively thinking about what transpired between me and this person. I have been reluctant to name it as harassment because I am aware that the stakes are quite different in this scenario. Naming a queer woman of color as a sexual harasser or predator has far greater stakes and implications than does naming a cishet white man. I don’t want to demonize this person, I don’t want her to lose her job, and I don’t want any of this information to be used to further devalue or disrespect her and her labor. For what it’s worth, I still care very much for her and hope she is able to find some solace in this fucked up world we all live in. 

One of the ways I have been able to come to terms with the trauma of that relationship has been to intellectualize the power dynamic. I know that she has also been the victim of harassment and abuse (both inside and outside of academe). In the context of heteropatriarchal US society and an extremely hierarchical system like the US academy wherein women (especially of color and queer) are devalued, manipulated, and abused at every turn, it is not surprising to me that someone might choose to exercise power in whatever scant ways possible. I’ve seen it over and over and over again wherein marginalized faculty (even the ones who we respect for their social justice scholarship etc.) lash out at or take advantage of grad students in various mental, emotional, and sexual ways. For example, I previously mentioned the messy boundaries I had with my advisor as I helped her through a personal crisis. That crisis was exacerbated by the university's complete lack of human regard for and callousness toward my advisor as she endured the unthinkable. As a person of conscience, I could not idly sit by and watch that crisis unfold, so I did what I could to help in whatever ways I was able. But in hindsight, I also realize that I may have done those things (unconsciously) because it was my first year on the job market and I needed my advisor to do some basic things, such as write letters of recommendation, and, you know, *advise* me during a time when she could very well have gone AWOL. 

Anyway, this is all to say: graduate students have become repositories for all of the academy’s dysfunction. Some faculty treat grad students like punching bags through which to exercise their own angst, and many graduate students are so insecure and/or neglected to such a degree in their programs that they mistake the punching for support. None of the people mentioned in this narrative are evil. Sexual harassment and other forms of abuse in academe are not the result of one or two or even 500 bad apples. The problem is systemic and cyclical. ",Female

The professor who told me decided to go to the associate dean who decided to let it die. He said it wasn't anything he wanted to pursue. While talking to another doc student who revealed she was being sexually harassed by another prof. in our department (my major professor's friend), I told her of my situation. A few weeks later she told another doc student, who told her many doc students in the department knew about it. That doc student then told another doc student who then went directly to the major professor and told him I knew about it then he called wanting to meet with me individually. He wouldn't tell me what he wanted to talk about but I had a suspicion it was about the ad. I called the anonymous graduate student ombudsman who informed me she had to report it because it was a Title IV issue. For 3 months the university HR Title IV rep worked with me to try to get him removed as my major professor. The dean of my department would not take a meeting with us so I had to continue with him as my major - all the while without talking to him at all. He told some of the other professors in the department that I launched an investigation against him and I got the cold shoulder (to say the least). When I was finally able to switch major professors I got a rude email from the dean saying how he thought it was inappropriate for me to invite the HR rep in a meeting and I needed to meet with the Program Director ALONE. (The program director is one of my old major professor's buddies). The university did investigate him & did nothing! He received tenure and I now have to deal with all the rumors that I launched an investigation & caused this guy trouble all because ""what he does in his private life is none of our business.""

Once I reached out to my department I found out he had been inappropriate to other graduate students and had sexually harassed a staff member over a period of months with no repercussions. He had a criminal record of multiple sexual assaults and rape (had spent decades in prison), but the Title IX office told me they could do nothing to remove him from the class unless he physically attacked me. He was switched out of my lab but remained in the large lecture I had to attend twice a week. I was told by Title IX to come late and leave early as well as sit in the back of the lecture hall so as to not be seen by him.

12/3/2017 22:16:34,"In my final few months of graduate school, my dissertation chair invited me to his hotel room while we were at a conference to talk about my work... moments into our ""discussion"" I found that he was taking his pants off and wanted sexual intercourse. I feared that he would no longer support me if I went against his wishes. At the same time, I worried that people I respected, including my committee members, would denigrate me and my work if it were known that I had had sexual intercourse with him. I took on the situation as my own psychologically, and continue to suffer deep emotional trauma from this experience. 

I later ended up working with this same professor post-graduation on a major research project, and while I had made clear that I was not interested in any sexual relationship with him, he proceeded to engage in aggressive sexual harassment and sexual assault in his role as my supervisor. Once I settled into the job, he began to routinely grope me at work. He put his hands on my breast and/or genitals whenever he could manage it. He regularly commented on my body, shape, size, and sex appeal. He has verbally and physically threatened to rape me on several occasions. At each meeting with him, I anticipate I will be subject to some sort of sexual abuse or public ridicule because of my gender, but he is my supervisor, letter writer, and a giant in my field. 

This harassment is on-going and while I want to file a complaint with my university, I have been told by many colleagues and other women he has abused that the university does not care about me/us; it will always protects its cherished professors. And I have watched closely as other complaints of sexual harassment and assault are poorly handled by my university -- and how each time the accuser lost and the accused, often a professor, was unharmed.

I am anxious and depressed and withdrawn from my colleagues. I have started to look for other career options despite having started off with significant promise in my field and a strong desire to continue my scholarship. ,"Too much to capture in words. Shame, humiliation, self-blame, guilt, insomnia, anxiety, panic attacks, depression. I have suffered repeated miscarriages, and have other significant health issues that are continuing and are directly related to the stress, anxiety, and emotional suffering that has resulted from this sexual harassment and abuse. ","Incalculable. It is the single defining situation in my life -- career and otherwise. I pray that others are spared this agony. 

I was the first in my immediate and extended family to attend college. My mother cleaned houses and my father was a construction worker who never finished high school. Education became my path to freedom... or so I had anticipated. I worked full time throughout college in order to finance my undergraduate education. It was a miracle that I was accepted to graduate school at a top research university on a full scholarship. This predator took advantage of my vulnerability -- as he put it, ""when I first met you, I knew I could do whatever I wanted to you."" 

Both my parents were absent from my life and I had no family support for what I was trying to achieve as a scholar. I was alone and vulnerable. I wanted to be seen, to be told I was smart, to be encouraged in my research, to be given an opportunity to become a professor. He strategically gave me all of what I longed for -- for a limited period of time, and just long enough to get what he wanted. He told me that I was his most brilliant student, I had so much potential, he wanted to help me succeed -- and then he took advantage of our relationship by coming on to me while I was his student, and later by sexually harassing me as his employee.  

But this is what happens to people like me in the academy -- the marginals within the ivory tower. We are subject to predators like this-- and sadly, the institutions that we depend on to protect and educate us, fail us entirely; instead, these elite institutions offer us up as a yet another perk to their full professors who have everything and nothing to lose. 

From this experience, I have learned that my life is less valuable than that of a sexual predator simply because he is a full tenured professor (whose achievements, by the way, are owed to the women that he has used to co-author his papers, teach his classes, and ghost write/edit his work and grant proposals, not to mention also the significant unacknowledged domestic labor of his wife). I have learned that if I complain, I will find that my job is suddenly without funding, and other colleagues in my field won't support me. These are terrible lessons to learn-- and I pray that someday they won't have to be learned by anyone because they won't exist anymore. 

The only way to ensure that this kind of exploitation and abuse stops is for universities to take sexual harassment seriously -- ZERO TOLERANCE -- to fire the perpetrator (tenured or otherwise) AND those in the administration and faculty who protect them. It is time for universities to protect the vulnerable in the community so that the university can be a space for EVERYONE. Until this happens, nothing will change; victims will continue to fear the loss of their jobs and reputation, and will continue to be too afraid to speak out.","The only way to ensure that this kind of exploitation and abuse stops is for universities to take sexual harassment seriously -- ZERO TOLERANCE -- to fire the perpetrator (tenured or otherwise) AND those in the administration and faculty who protect them.

12/3/2017 23:30:20,"So I began Undergrad as a joint degree student in tech theater and linguistics. By spring of my first year, I was the youngest assistant stage manager in the dept’s history attributed to my prior experience, enrolled in 22 credits (mostly theater), and basically in the department 9-12 hours a day/6 days a week. Because of my involvement in the show, the other faculty in the production also had my personal contact info (phone, room number, etc.). The stage crew director (faculty member) began texting me seemingly innocent enough about show related things, but it quickly escalated to pressuring me to spend time with him outside of work related things. He also taught one of my classes, and would come up behind me and rub my back. I would shake him off and he’d come back the next class. He touched other girls too, rubbing their backs. I was 17, having started college young, and I was glad to be in this show and out in a big city on my own. But I did know his actions were wrong. I first told a senior in the department how uncomfortable he made me, and she said he had a reputation for that behavior and she would try to watch my back and deflect him. That worked for the physical touch but didn’t stop the texts and calls at night. I kept saying no. Finally grades came out at my marks were far lower than any contributing assignment’s marks would have led me to anticipate. I had been a high school valedictorian (weighted). I was pissed. I went to the show’s director in tears and asked how this could happen (showing high marks consistently on grades). He told me he didn’t believe in grades anyway and that if I cared about my grades, this department wasn’t for me. He didn’t acknowledge he objective discrepancy at all. I spoke with the female department chair and she said (and I’ll never fucking forget it): “you’re young, sure, but you can’t honstly tell me you didn’t know what you needed to do to get a good grade from him!” I walked out sobbing while she laughed. I left the major and didn’t look back. In the two years that followed, many of my friends from the department shared similar stories with me, and nothing changed. Finally, in my final year, one of my close friends from the theater dept became Miss Maryland and was on the TLC show and became a local celeb, especially for the small college where I was. She had been harassed by him consistently and raised the issue (using her newfound platform) to the university level administration. Within the semester, he was gone. The next semester spring before I graduated I was funneled into a 1:1 advising meeting for competitive graduate scholarships with a memeber of the university president’s office. I told her why that one semester’s grades were so bad that it took me from summa cum laude to magma cum laude (basically killing any chance for these kinds of scholarships). Her response: “well if your grades were that important to you, you should have left the dept when you thought the teacher would jeopardize that.” I’d been in performing arts for almost a decade by the time I started college, and I have never done it since. I loved our school, but the whole experience was a huge black cloud. Oh, and as if that weren’t enough, I was in ***’s book like almost every other girl I knew. I didn’t remember the interaction with him that led to my entry in his journal. But I think the university’s whole non-handling of that situation was pretty egregious. I’ve been very lucky in grad school off and on in the last 10 years, nothing like this has ever happened again.

12/4/2017 0:37:00,"A mentor paid ambiguous and uncomfortable amount of time and energy on me that felt like (but was never articulated) a bid for a relationship. I worked for him as a teaching and research assistant. In thanks for my hard work, he took me out to dinner at a restaurant well beyond my means. As a private pilot, he also, for ostensibly other reasons, took me out for a day in his plane. I was too young to know how to decline or to determine whether I was making too much of his advances. I was quite alright, in the end. He never forced the issue and remained supportive of my work and career until his death. It was less of a physical attack and more of an emotional toll too heavy for a young academic worrying about her career, her status, appropriate responses, image in the department, real motivations, etc. In context, this mentor was a serial husband. He had 7 marriages by the time he died. I am quite unscathed, in the long run, and he was a very good mentor otherwise. But, I learned a lot that has prevented me from being in situations that would have likely turned out quite worse.","I was a graduate student (Masters/PhD). It was in my first & second year that these events occurred, but I continued to have interactions with him for the remaining 4 years that made me uncomfortable.","He was a famous figure in the field, a full professor at the university.  He was a mentor/supervisor, in charge of classes and research projects I had been assigned to, though he was not a supervisor/member of my PhD committee.

I do have a mental illness that was diagnosed at the start of our interactions, and it contributed to the problems I was experiencing. Also, the conflicting support/sympathy for my situation co-existing with dismissal of his actions left me confused and distrusting until I could find my feet.","Not really much for trajectory; perhaps the opposite. His positive mentorship has led me to an excellent position in my field that combines my primary discipline with his. As mentioned above, it was also a learning experience. So, in terms of life choices, I have definitely learned that academic opportunity is not always sufficient excuse for putting myself in compromising situations. And, it also makes me quite close to the other men in my life who have been mentors and supportive and have never remotely indicated that there was an intimate interest.","I recognise that the story here is not, by far, the worst you're going to see. In fact, I've done more than survive, I've thrived, in part because of my harasser. In fact, was he a harasser? It's the ambiguity, confusion and distrust that remains... I don't want my story to be included if it diminishes the severity of other peoples' stories. However, since this is about a sense of scale, I thought it was worth including as an indication how the institution enables, perhaps embodies, this behaviour.

12/4/2017 1:31:23,"I had an emotionally abusive relationship with my dissertation advisor that ultimately involved sexual harrasment.  All throughout my time in the program he would alternate between extravagant praise and career-threating criticism (like failing me in my qualifying exams and not accepting chapters of my dissertation), and with every conflict I would seek to end the relationship and ask  my second reader, a woman, to direct my dissertation instead. She would always refuse because she thought it would ""look bad,"" and intercede with my director, and the next round would start all over again; I would be the golden child until the moment I was totally inept and wrong and had no business being in a doctoral program. The roots of the dynamic all became clear to me when I came out as transgender and transitioned male-to-female in 1992 right at the end of my graduate program. I had been afraid that if I came out too soon my advisor would find a way to deny me the degree I had worked so hard for. Even though I had started living socially as the person I considered myself to be about a year earlier, and was taking hormones, I was not out in my doctoral program. I finished and filed the dissertation under my old name/gender, and the second I was notified that the degree had been award I went back to my committee to have the title page amended to reflect my new name. I got the other two signatures first, then went to my advisor's house to have him sign it as well. I decided that a quick approach was best. When asked what I needed, I said simply ""Let me cut to the chase. I'm transsexual and changing my sex. I need you to sign a new title page for me."" I already had pen and page in hand, handed him both, and got the signature before he had time to really process anything. But as soon as he signed, he started literally panting and grunting with emotion, and said ""Ugh, umm, ahh, I...I have long considered you a rather attractive young woman."" He asked me if I went to sex parties and did party drugs and if so could I maybe invite him some time or score something? All the years of emotional whiplash became instantly clear. He had been hot for me but because he understood me to be a guy he hadn't come on to me, just punished me for being the object of his repressed homosexual desire, but now that he could consider me a woman, it was suddenly ""hey baby how 'bout it?"" He offered me money ""on retainer"" to buy drugs. I took his money, walked out of the room, never spoke to him again, never asked him for anything let alone a letter of recommendation, never tried to publish my dissertation, never tried seriously to get a job in the academy until I had built up a new field of expertise in another discipline--that took me another seventeen years.  Being inappropriately sexualized by a person in a position of power over me totally affected my life and career-path. I've always been reluctant to share this story publicly, mostly because the conflict didn't involve physical contact, just emotional twistedness, and would be just a she said/he said thing.

12/4/2017 1:37:19,"Too many individual incidents to recount so I'll focus on one: In grad school a professor made multiple inappropriate comments about women in the women's history class she was teaching. All the students in this relatively small class were women. Most were straight, some were queer. The professor self identified as a lesbian, and would talk about her sexuality in mildly inappropriate ""joking"" ways in class and in office hours to ""test the water"" with individual students, even though she was in a committed long term relationship. She would often ask us about our sexual relationships with other women, and if two of us talked to each other outside class and she saw us, she'd assume we were sleeping together and would question us about it. The worst remarks I recall her making in class were when she joked about ""pimping us all out,"" going so far as to name the nearby street where she envisioned turning us out as prostitutes. Most of us laughed nervously, a few people rolled their eyes or murmured in protest. She pretended these were ""just jokes"" but it was clearly giving her pleasure to abuse her power in this way--she enjoyed making us feel uncomfortable. She harassed the straight women in class incessantly. When she found out I was queer she backed off a little on me--I think she was afraid that if a queer woman reported her for sexual harassment it would have more weight. She didn't harass the other out queer woman in class much either.

12/4/2017 5:01:17,"In fall 1971, my sophomore year, I enrolled in a class taught by an African American male faculty member who had a reputation for sexually harassing female students. As I was  African American and his previous targets had all been white, I assumed I was safe. Around midterm, he insisted I was too advanced for the topic he’d assigned most of the class for a final paper and would need to meet with him in private to devise a topic for me. I knew that “private meetings” with him had been occasions for various forms of browbeating and manipulation for other women. Thus, I spent the remainder of the semester insisting I was too busy to meet with him and begging for a paper topic. Finally, realizing that if I failed to write a paper because I had no assigned topic I could be flunked, I explained my dilemma to another (legitimately) advanced student and asked her to share her topic with me, adding I would do my own research and inevitably produce results different from her own so there should be no question of plagiarism. She agreed. I thoroughly researched and carefully wrote my paper, vowing not to complain as long as the professor gave me a grade of B or above. Less than that and I felt confident my complaint would be taken seriously by the committee on faculty conduct, as I was a well-known, well-liked student with an excellent academic record who was also one of the leaders of the campus black student organization. The professor had been brought up on sexual harassment charges the previous year, but managed to elude censure by painting himself a victim of racism—a claim that would be much harder to make in my case. I received a B for the course, so felt no need to take matters further. The following semester, however, the professor flagged me down one day in the Student Union. He was seated with the girl who’d shared her topic with me and her boyfriend, another of the prof’s advanced students. The prof proceeded to inform me he’d been so impressed by my term paper that he wanted to meet with me to discuss the possibility of collaborating on its publication. At that point, I loudly informed him I was no longer his student, told him exactly what I thought of him and marched off.","Second year undergraduate, not planning to major in the professor’s field",Tenured faculty,Small Liberal Arts College,,The class was in music history; my major would eventually be literature.,,None sought,None,Taught me that sexual harassment was about gender not race.,"It was extremely upsetting at the time, though I was able to vent, strategize and get moral support from my roommate and several other women students in whom I confided.

12/4/2017 7:24:39,"There is one man I know who has a terrible reputation for inappropriate behavior among almost all of the women who know him.  In my last two years of graduate school, I became a member of the same society of fellows that he belonged to.  This fellowship invites its graduated fellows back once a year, so I see him every year that I attend.  He is now a tenured professor at a respected university.

It is hard to explain how insidious this man's actions are.  I first met him in my first year of graduate school, when he briefly dated a friend of mine.  He was extremely full of himself, and when I saw him now and then at school events, he was one of those awful men who made long-winded comments in the Q & A.  But I really only got to know him when I was inducted into the fellowship, and he targeted me.

Every year, he has this habit of identifying the newest, prettiest women, and he follows them around flirting/insulting them.  At the fellowship meeting that first year, as I asked this (married) professor for advice about the job market, he would sprinkle in little comments like ""If only I had met you earlier...""  I was initially flattered, but over time I began to see that it was a ritual.  The last time I attended, he (and a few other senior male colleagues) latched onto a beautiful Asian graduate student.  When he is in this predatory mode, he will come over and put an arm around your shoulders or a hand on your waist.  He will get in your personal space, and treat it like a game when you try to rebuff him.

I graduated, moved on to my postdoc, and one year into it, he became a visiting scholar at the same institution.  In fact, he was put at the next desk over.  He was always leaning around the partition to bother me, and there was always a sexual undertone.  This is where it gets harder to pin down though.  The only specific incident that I can remember is when we were talking to a couple of other people and I said something about a box, and he gave suggestive look a look and said ""Your BOX?""  It was things like that.  Always bringing it back to sex, when we were in our WORKPLACE.  And then when it was about work, such as at my public lecture, he would tell people behind my back about how unoriginal my ideas were or how unconvincing my argument was.

I complained about him so much that after I left the postdoc, my boyfriend (now husband) encouraged me to unfriend him on Facebook.  That was liberating, even though he made comments about it at the next annual meeting.

I knew I wasn't the only one who felt this way (the mere mention of his name often elicits an eye roll), but I was surprised when a friend at another school brought him up this fall (pre-Harvey Weinstein).  She was a graduate student a few years before me, and she'd had the same experience.  We had been talking about inappropriateness from male colleagues in general, and she said something like, ""Well, you-know-who is the worst.""  I suddenly though, Yeah, isn't it a problem that all of these women have felt threatened by him?

I know you will hear much worse stories, but this type of sexual harassment is completely pervasive and undermines our careers.  It is men treating women as sexual objects rather than colleagues.  It doesn't matter what you wear or how you act.  These men perpetuate an uncomfortable atmosphere for women, make us insecure about our self-image and our accomplishments, and have the power to pass on their opinions to others.","graduate student (Penn), then post-doc (NYU)","senior fellow in my graduate fellowship (Penn) and professor at another institution, and then visiting scholar (with tenure I believe) at my postdoc (NYU).

12/4/2017 7:31:08,"Where to begin?! 

I am choosing to include a professional music festival in the definition of academy because I attended for work purposes to collaborate and bond with peer musicians. 

I met a friend and collaborator at a professional music festival in the summer of 2014. The following summer, he contacted me saying he would be passing through my part of the country; he lives in New York but had a residency in Wyoming, just an hour north of my tourist destination in Colorado. He asked if he could sleep on my couch for a weekend and sight see. I happily obliged. We were encouraged by our festival staff to stay in touch for collaborative purposes, and he and I had worked on a new music commission together previously. 

Rather immediately after I drove an hour to pick him up from his residency, he made small talk about sex, which made me uncomfortable. But I thought, we are supposed to be peers, friends, mature adults... If he feels like discussing his sex life, I'll accommodate him, but I won't discuss mine. He emphasized his open relationship with his girlfriend back home. Without wanting to feed my own ego, I kept fighting the nagging feeling that he was discussing this to set us up for a hook up later. 

The day went on with dinner and other sight seeing, and all the while I felt inexplicably uncomfortable. 

That night, I tried to be a basic, good host by putting on some Netflix. I sat on the opposite end of the couch. I could feel him inching closer. Before it could get more awkward, and all the while doubting he'd do anything and that I'm just assuming he's coming close because I have an ego, I got up to leave. I said, ""I'm going to bed. Do you have everything you need?"" He made me feel weird - ""Is something wrong? Why did you get up all of a sudden?"" I told him nothing, just tired, do you need anything, etc. I went to bed. He then made loud noises - absolutely slamming cabinet doors, knocking wine bottles over, uncontrollably high from his local souvenirs. 

I returned to the living room to ask ""Is everything okay?"" He took this as me wanting attention from him, rather than me being perturbed that he's so loud and disrespectful. ""Why do you keep checking on me?"" I told him he's being loud, and my roommate - a young cousin of mine who I'm protective of - is trying to sleep. 

This happened twice more. 

After going to bed a third time, I heard him knock on my door and whisper my name. He tried to enter. I got up to greet him - ""What do you need?"" Rather than answer, he said ""Why do you keep asking me that? Do you want to hang out?"" I told him no. He tried to enter many more times that night. I slept with a can of hair spray. 

This grey area was so uncomfortable. This was supposed to be a friendly weekend hosting a professional peer on my sofa, but the following morning, I lied and told him I had too much graduate school homework to focus, so I paid for him to get an Airbnb and stay somewhere else. 

I asked friends for advice. Some said that simply by turning on Netflix I led him on. I highly disagree. I know I was a bit cold and professional. Others said this was inexcusable. This was supposed to be a professional peer. Why did this happen? Anytime I see someone who resembles him, I actually get scared.

12/4/2017 7:55:06,"I was attending a summer classical music festival with peer professionals. We were all considered ""fellows"" - not staff and students, due to a wide range of ages. Some participants were post-doctoral and nearly the same age as staff who are professors back home. We were there to create new music together as composers and instrumentalists. 

My instrument group - saxophonists - happened to be comprised of some of America's top performing individuals, so I was excited to collaborate and even bond with them while in Italy. 

However, being the only girl, I often felt left out. I would go to dinner with them in the evenings, but they would spend this time talking about their sex lives. Not just open, healthy sex talk - talk ALWAYS defined by women being stupid, objectified, and/or demeaned. I cannot emphasize this point enough. Perhaps I was prude - I don't believe so - but even if I weren't, this was not healthy sex talk. 

Example: ""This girl at a party made a racist statement toward me, but it was okay because I got her drunk and she showed me her boobs. So who won? Me.""

""This girl was so stupid. She thought I wanted a relationship, so I let her think it until i'd had enough sex, then just stopped texting her.""

Worse still was the constant explicit commentary on staff members' bodies. Two of the women staffing the festival were my professors back home, both modest, respectable, and world renowned in their fields. Comments I heard regularly were ""I wish I could see up her skirt when she bends down"", and ""I'd pee in her butt."" You heard me right. This kind of stuff is hilarious to these guys, but it's so non-consensual on the part of the women! They are there to be respected! The men staffing the festival have none of these problems at all. 

Also, as a woman, I could literally break down how respected and listened to I was based on whether or not I wore makeup. These were sweltering days in Italy with no breeze or ice in drinks, so I often skipped makeup to avoid itchy skin. Male peers literally ignored me when I spoke. When I wore makeup, they listened intently without processing what I was saying. 

Lastly, there was an evening where I was with these male peers on a mission to buy a bottle of wine. They told me to ""flirt"" to get a discount. The wine shop owner was a bald middle-aged man. I jokingly said I would, but when I turned around, my friends were gone and I was alone with this man. I actually got scared and emerged - drunk from our earlier dinner - only to be made a total fool in front of professors while my peers told my staff I was drunk and flirting. I had actually been quite scared.

12/4/2017 7:57:10,"When I was 19, I took an introductory English major course taught by a tenured male professor.  I learned throughout the semester that the professor had a poor reputation because of his stringent guidelines and arbitrary grading practices; but I was unaware of his history of sexual misconduct with students--until I became the target of that harassment.  Though some of his comments throughout the semester were off-color, I tended to ignore it.  But, one day, I wore a gray dress to his class, an anomaly for me as I favor pants and more casual clothes.  The dress set him off.  He exclaimed that it was nice to see me dressing that way; but that he wished I wore more colors (I tend to dress monochromatically in blacks and grays) and that, given my complexion (I am Mexican-American) I would look particularly good in pastel colors.  He then proceeded to derail class discussion in favor of polling my classmates about whether or not they thought I would look better in pinks and purples and more lady-like clothing.  If they chose not to answer, he forced them to.  Many of my male classmates eagerly participated.  I remember explaining to him that my sartorial choices were based on my disdain for traditionally feminine colors and that, as a former dancer, I'd worn enough brightly colored dresses to last a lifetime.  That was the wrong thing to say.  He became enamored of my past as a ballerina, a fascination that continued when he enrolled his young daughter in a beginning dance class I taught in town--a class that I taught while wearing a leotard and tights.  Though he did not harass me at my workplace, his snide comments on my appearance and clothing continued in class.  For instance, I wore a bandana in my hair one day (think Rosie the Riveter) and he told me I looked like a ""feminazi"".  Because I had to deal with him long after I completed his class (because I taught his daughter dance), I was always on guard.  The last time I heard from him, he messaged me on my personal Facebook page (we are, obviously, not Facebook friends but have mutual friends on Facebook apparently) to explain that he is ""proud of me"" for my accomplishments as a graduate student.

The overwhelming majority of my generation of graduate student (both men and women) are sensitive to this issue in the way I would hope ANY good philosopher would be. Yet so many perpetrators keep the jobs that the rest of us have to fight for. If philosophers can't figure out how to clearly identify what is wrong about this pattern and come up with a way to fix it, then it's true. Doing philosophy, for the most part, is pointless.

In other words, the impact this has on my trajectory: the overwhelming inability of administrations and departments to better the mistreatment of women has caused me to seriously question whether I will continue with philosophy.","I have made sure to leave out any identifying information.

I got away by mentioning that the main instructor for the class was expecting me to start the video and would probably come in herself any moment. He was our associate chair at the time and, as such, as in charge of TA assignments for the next semester.

He would schedule our appointments around 8 at night after his other office hours were over, and during the last appt I had with him, locked the door with a key (which I believe locked both sides of the door). During that last appointment with him, while we sat on the couch, he ran his hand down my arm and then caressed my waist, and then asked for a hug -- putting his face so close to mine that I sensed he wanted to kiss me. Ultimately, because I stopped communicating with him, he did not provide substantial comments on my thesis -- sending my main thesis advisor only one line of dismissive text to comment on my paper.

-says that he ""likes"" me often
-casually asked me to tell him “about myself” around 7:45 after going over poems
-asked me to come back the following week
-asked for a hug after our session

-asked me where I had been; said it was a long time since he last saw me
-expresses often that “he likes talking to me” or that he “likes” me
-asked me if I was going to be around for spring break (the next week), as if I could come meet with him then 
-says that he likes talking to me
-he said ""he would love to spend all night reading poetry with me"" but he ""had to go""
-asked for a hug afterward, which involved more body contact than necessary

-He made it known to all students waiting when I arrived for Office Hours that he would “save (My name) for last,” and asked some students who had been waiting for a while to come back some other time. Met with only one other student very quickly before me and then met with me.
-He closed his office door. He sat on his couch and invited me to sit down also, and then he sat in closer proximity to me; often would touch my arm/elbow for longer than a second
-He turned off the light, and the door was locked from the outside. I know this because he went to talk to someone he heard in the hallway and then came back and had to unlock the door.
-After we discussed poems until around 8pm, he said he wanted to ""stop work stuff"" and then asked me about how I was doing and I told him I had developed a repetitive stress injury; he was overly sympathetic and suddenly leaned in close to me and ran his hand slowly down my arm, starting from my shoulder. We both quickly pretended like nothing just happened.
-Later, after he told me about his trip to the east coast, he began wrapping up our conversation, and, while still sitting near me on the couch, he asked for a hug. Although I did not want one, I was afraid to say no so I did not protest. He made it longer and closer than necessary and his left hand touched down my side and waist and lingered. I just turned away very quickly as soon as I had moved away and averted my eyes and he had jumped to behind his desk and continued conversation as if nothing had happened.
-He asked me to meet with him again before I was gone/post graduating so that I may say goodbye
-He told me he really enjoyed our sessions, and so I told him our sessions were ""helpful,"" and he said if they were ""merely helpful"" then his “feelings were hurt.” I did not respond
-He talked about how he ""tailors his pedagogical relationships with his students to best fit their needs"" as if to explain what was happening and then began talking about ""transference"" in an indirect way
-I felt very shocked and uncomfortable afterward; told three people close to me right away and my main thesis adviser within a week

12/4/2017 10:22:57," In 1972-3, when I was taking my second degree (this time in biology), I heard rumors about a tenured senior professor, a renowned botanist; I wanted to take his class on Native Plants, open only to upper-division students.  There are two parts to this:  what I heard, and what I personally experienced/observed.  

What I heard was that he was a creep and a lech who used office hours to get undergraduates in his office and onto a couch-bed he kept there; that the departmental parties at his house were ""wild"" and involved drinking, drugs, some nudity, and sexual harassment of women students who attended.  The class I took was not the only class he taught.  He was said to have taken pictures of his wife on the toilet, and to have shown them at some of these parties.  There were specific instances given which, 45 years later, I can't recall clearly enough, but I was told that some women dropped a class, or even dropped out.   I do remember being warned that he liked to use the ""You're not a prude, are you?"" mode of persuasion (this being the early 70s, it worked on too many young women.)   And he had a habit of locking his office door if the student gave him a chance.

What I observed:  In our lab sessions (when we dissected flowers under the microscope to identify the species) was that he liked to roam around ""helping"" students, and often touched them on the back or shoulder; the male students got a pat; the women students got a squeeze on the shoulder and he was clearly looking down their fronts, not at the specimens.  We had graduate student T.A.s, both in the lab and on the field trips (out to various sites to collect native plant material for identification.)   I found it easy to avoid touch in the lab and on the field trips, and did not attend any departmental parties at his house.

What I experienced:  I was an older student, with a history degree (Rice U.) and military experience behind me--and I was married.   Also I was then tall and very fit, less than a year off active duty.  So although I was propositioned and lightly insulted, I had been forewarned and also had resources he would not expect.  It did not affect me as much as it would have a younger, more vulnerable person.   I needed to ask him a question about an upcoming field trip and went to his office during office hours.   I stood back from his desk, between him and the unlocked door.   The setup in his office was as described: a low bed against the wall to the left (he had a big office, as befitted his academic rank)  covered in a quilt, with pillows making it a plausible couch, with a bead curtain in front of it, held back partway on the sides.  Very harem-inspired.  He  got up from his desk and approached, suggested that I ""get comfortable"" on the couch so we could discuss the field trip.   I declined.  He said ""You're not a prude are you? What, you think I might attack you or something?""  I said ""No, I'm married,"" and he immediately said ""You're not going to let that stop you..."" and did the raking head to toe survey with a long pause at my (then small but not invisible through my shirt ) frontage.  ""And I'm an ex-Marine,"" I said, giving him a firm look.  He puffed up and changed color and I repeated my question about the field trip schedule (one had been re-scheduled due to weather) and he answered sounding angry.   I left, convinced that the rumors I'd heard had been true, and that if I'd been younger and without the military experience, I'd have been struggling to get out from under him.  It stuck in my mind over the years particularly because so many upper-division undergraduate women and graduate student women passed the rumors about him.",Undergraduate major in the department,"Senior tenured professor, much published, widely known in his field.   ",Other R1,University of Texas at Austin,Biology,,I did not report the incident;  I hadn't been physically assaulted and would have had no idea how to report even if I had been.  ,"None.  It was clear he was highly prized by the department.  If the institution was aware of the rumors, his reputation as a botanist protected him.","I became much more aware of sexual harassment (instead of the steady anti-female bias I'd faced all through school) and when I went into grad school a year later chose a female thesis director.   Other things impacted my career more, including the still-strong bias against women in science, the constant gaslighting, and some medical issues completely unrelated to the harassment.","Immediate: despite having been warned I found his behavior shocking as well as unprofessional.   I was determined to stay away from him after that, and became more suspicious of other faculty and grad students, and long term more cynical about men and their behaviors to this day.  But that was not the only incident (like many women I'd had previous incidents, starting in childhood.) In total, the various incidents and the anti-woman bias and gaslighting definitely affected my confidence, my ability to concentrate, my trust in both men and the legal systems supposed to protect us from predators.   This particular incident actually gave me confidence, in that I had ""done the right thing"" of situational awareness and a firm response to his attempts.  Overall, though, it 's just one bright spot.  ","Cumulative affect of harassment, including this, was to make me less able to compete, more likely to just walk away from conflicts and opportunities that seemed too good for me.  Looking back from the age of 70+, I know I have sabotaged myself both by not reaching for the prize, and by going full-on Marine when it wasn't the best strategy...and I know where the sudden crevasses of confidence come from.  But I still fall into them.  I had once dreamed of an academic career, but by the time I left graduate school short of a graduate degree, I had realized that it was far from the safe haven I'd thought when I was a bookish girl.  instead I'm a moderately successful novelist doing wildlife management and prairie restoration on the side.  (My graduate work was in ecology.)   Married (made a success of that--48 years), one adopted son.   Could I have made a success of an academic career if no harassment had ever occurred?  Probably.  I was smart enough, energetic, willing to work, eager to learn (still am eager to learn) and got along with many kinds of people...though not with some.  How much of that is due to how I was treated, I don't know.  ","Other forms of abuse related to gender but not overtly sexual reinforced the sexual harassment--not just for me, but for other girls and women I knew.   Attacking a woman's confidence in her sanity, her intelligence, her ""drive,"" her appearance, etc. erodes the sense of self as a worthwhile individual.   For me, it has been the combination of attacks that's had the long-lasting effect...It was like trying to run up a greased staircase.  If you took the hard classes anyway, studied hard anyway, avoided the obvious traps (drinking, drugs, illicit sex) you could still be clobbered for being plain, badly dressed, having the wrong skin color,  being a child of divorce (a club I was beaten with all through school), and told that any or several of these things proved you'd never succeed, never get out of the low box you belonged in.  And the pretty, well-dressed girls could be dissed for being ""party girls"" and ""not really serious"" about their education, or (in college) that they'd slept their way to their grades.   I know this questionnaire is just about sexual harassment, but I had to bring the rest up.  Thank you.",Male

12/4/2017 10:50:00,"In 2014-2015, a female colleague and friend (then a graduate student) became involved in a secret, polyamorous relationship with another female graduate student and a male adjunct faculty member. Technically, this relationship was in violation of the university's sexual conduct policies, as the adjunct faculty member taught in the graduate students' department. The relationship turned unhealthy when the male partner began to play each of the female partners against each other. Ultimately, my friend (who also lives with bipolar disorder) despaired and committed an act of self-harm. Though she recovered and remained active in the program, my friend's action brought the previously secret relationship to the attention of other graduate students in the department. However, my friend's female and male former partners both actively sought to maintain the relationship's secrecy by harassing and threatening other graduate students who inquired about the relationship and/or offered my friend support. The former partners successfully recruited some graduate students to their ""side,"" which created a stilted he-said/she-said/she-said dynamic. My friend, out of a combination of fear of drawing further departmental attention to herself and of potential reprisals from her former partners, insisted that none of this behavior be reported officially. At the time, I agreed out of respect for her wishes; I have come to regret this decision. In the end, the events were an open secret, as the entire graduate student body in the department became embroiled in the affair. One graduate student -- who bore the brunt of the female and male partners' harassment and bullying because of her advocacy on my friend's behalf -- left the program the following year.",Graduate student,"One graduate student, one adjuct faculty member",Elite Institution/Ivy League,,Theater and Performance Studies,,"None, as it was never formally filed. When I encountered repercussions from one of the former partners (see below), I sought advice from departmental faculty members. They offered emotional support and some advice on how to proceed, but there was no official response. Both faculty members with whom I discussed my experiences shared some version of the observation that the graduate student scenario mirrored their personal experiences in faculty meetings and that bullying was rife throughout academia. Perhaps unsurprisingly, as victims of such behavior themselves, they did not offer any clear-cut solutions, only (much-needed) emotional support.","None. The graduate students remained in the program, and the adjunct faculty member returned to teach courses the following year.","The year after the events (2015-2016), I became the graduate student representative in my department. Though the events were never pursued through any formal complaint or through any public forum, they continued to structure a great deal of graduate student life in and around the department. The female graduate student/harasser identified me as someone who supported my friend (which, admittedly, I had), and therefore treated me with open hostility in meetings. This behavior increased in severity throughout my tenure as representative, and boiled over around a policy proposal that I put forward over our systems of self-governance (the proposal was that all positions be elected democratically, thus ending the unilateral selection processes that were then in place). Over two months, I received threatening emails and ultimatums to retract my proposal prior to our democratic vote on the topic. Departmental politicking ensued in which two camps appeared, both of which mirrored the ""sides"" that had formed in response to the prior year's harassment. During the meeting, the female student/harasser and one of her close allies voiced accusations that I was abusing my power and that I was targeting them personally. They refused to permit others present from discussing the proposal, and they insistently returned the topic of conversation to their accusations and their grievances. The female student/harasser's side carried the day, having convinced (or intimidated) enough of the other graduate students to vote down the proposal. It strikes me as deeply ironic that my colleagues elected to democratically refuse the prospect of more democratic processes. Moreover, it strikes me that the scenario is a textbook case of projection, in which the female student/harasser accused me of carrying out a vendetta against her through departmental politics as an explicit justification for her vendetta against me.","For the remainder of the 2015-2016 academic year, I was in something of a state of shock. I avoided campus as much as possible. The following fall, I began to experience symptoms of anxiety when I would commute to campus. When I was on campus, I would avoid my department as I did not want to encounter the female student/harasser or her primary ally. Ultimately, I sought out a month of counseling on campus, but I did not find that very helpful as it required me to come to campus for sessions. Ultimately, I threw myself into my work and made my priority the completion of my degree and finding a job elsewhere.","My graduate program typically lasts 5-6 years. Though I was able to obtain funding for a sixth year, I chose to complete my degree in five, largely because of my desire to remove myself from an unhealthy environment. I was fortunate in that I was able to land a job right out of my graduate program, which has allowed me to move on from these rough three years. However, the experience has alerted me to the ways that harassment stems from broader systems of abuse, how it operates systemically and reaches far beyond any originary event, and how not everyone makes it through such experiences as smoothly as I have. The silver lining (if there is one) is that I have become much more alert to patterns of harassment and abuse in the world around me.","Thank you for taking the time to assemble this information.

I was amazed that, at age 45, I would be sexually harassed at my workplace, somewhere that, until earlier this year with the Tristan Retkke civil rights intimidation, I’ve always felt very physically safe, very protected because of the regular training everyone at ETSU receives regarding diversity and harassment. I took one or two days off work to process the experience because I was unable to focus on my work. I decided to report this to the Office of Equity and Diversity because I understand the psychology and personality of people who sexually harass; they habitually offend because of their sense of entitlement; plus they’re usually allowed to repeat their bad behavior. I don’t want XXXXX to sexually harass any of our students, staff, or other faculty. I feel like I’ve dealt with this fairly well, but I know that others are not as well-grounded as I, and I wish to prevent anyone else, particularly our vulnerable students, from suffering due to XXXXX’s callousness and illegal remarks. 
This was not the first time I was sexually harassed in my workplace (this happened in 1992). The harassment this October triggered flashbacks of the earlier physical sexual harassment that I experienced, as well as a resurfacing memories of the negative and cursory attempt of that workplace to investigate the claim, which the company failed to take action on. The 2016 harassment has had a significant affect upon my emotions and my physical health. 
Until that day I’d consistently come to the CPA 5, 6, or sometimes 7 days a week, to exercise. Since then, motivation for pursuing my health goals has plummeted and I’ve gained 5-10 pounds because I’m not exercising consistently. That may not seem extreme, but taking each of those pounds off was a struggle and a reflection of very hard work at the CPA and attention to nutrition, which has also slipped, as I tend to eat as a stress-response. Every time I come to the CPA I consciously avoid going near the Freshens area or catching XXXXX’s attention. When I can, I time my workouts within the small window when the Freshens smoothie area is closed. Instead of being a safe and welcoming place, the CPA has very negative associations for me. Up until October, I’d never felt unwelcome or out of place at the CPA. The permanent staff of the CPA, student workers, and people using the gym—staff, students, faculty, etc. create a supportive and welcoming environment. The CPA was my happy place and I relished the time I spent there. I’m very upset that my exercise regimen has stalled because of XXXXX’s verbal harassment of a sexual nature and inappropriate comments about my body. 
Besides building muscle and cardio conditioning, I use visits to the CPA as a means for controlling my stress. Going everyday made a dent in my stress. Now, going once a week, or once every two weeks, is not controlling my stress. In fact, it creates anxiety for me because I must be hyper-vigilant about not attracting any harassment from XXXXX or other people. It’s irrational because I know that everything I do at the gym is perfectly normal and within regular expectations of types of exercises. Further, my attire has always met and exceeded the dress code suggested for CPA gym-goers, but since XXXXX’s comments about my body and weight, I am anxious and motivated to conceal as much of my person as possible. 
While I made an initial inquiry about filing a complaint in October, I’ve delayed making a formal, written complaint because reliving the experience by writing about it, and then describing the affect it’s had on me, is unpleasant. Analyzing how it’s distressed me will make me dwell on it for days and disturb my mood and emotional state.

12/4/2017 11:14:01,"I was the sole graduate student representative on a university committee charged with evaluating faculty applications for a faculty teaching honor society. All faculty members of the committee were members of the honor society. Committee members were to be paired in teams to evaluate a stack of applications. After our first committee meeting, a tenured professor (about 40 years older than me and from another department) complimented my ideas in front of the whole committee and requested to work with me specifically. At the time, I was excited to be 'chosen' by a faculty member and to receive recognition for my ideas. He invited me to sit in on one of his undergraduate lectures and meet with him afterward in his office to discuss our committee obligations. In our conversation, he asked me about my research and I shared information about my project (and the fact that my project was informed by a personal experience of reproductive loss) . He told me that he *knew* he sensed something *different* about me, but presumed that I had been sexually molested. He then put his hands on my upper thigh and started caressing me. I almost overlooked the fact that he was touching me because I was so horrified and self-conscious thinking that something about how I conducted myself at the first committee meeting gave him the false impression that I had been sexually molested. In retrospect, I now that he was fishing for information and testing the waters with me to assess my vulnerabilities. And I know now that I was targeted by him, which is why he specifically asked to work with me in a team. But at the time, I completely internalized blame for what was happening and thought that I must have done or said something to give him this impression.

12/4/2017 14:29:09,"Bear with me. I'm shocked at how long ago this was and shocked at how immediate the pain can still feel. I'm not sure when it began, but if it had begun obviously, then it might have been avoidable (or so I am telling myself). 

This begins in the late 1980s and continues through the 1990s. The perpetrator was a history professor at my undergraduate and graduate institution. I took two classes from him in successive semesters in a subject that I had been dying to study from a professional since I was nine years old. At the end of the last semester, upon finding out I was about to graduate, he asked me to lunch in the faculty restaurant because, he told me, he always took his graduating students to lunch. I thought nothing of this, including the fact that I was the only student at lunch since this was December graduation, and was flattered. 

About a year or two later, after a major depressive breakdown and recovery, I had decided that I wanted to go to graduate school and become a historian specializing in that field. I went to talk with him about pursuing a degree. He recommended a number of good schools, but said that the best was right there at the University of Houston, studying with him. I look back on it now and laugh at how naïve I was. I actually believed him that it was a good idea to study colonial Native American history at University of Houston with a military historian who knew nothing about Native Americans. (He has, of course, in the past decade co-written a book about Native Americans in the American Revolution. That was my dissertation proposal. Not that I had a monopoly on topic, but still.)

Now, understand that no one had told me that the school should offer you funding or anything like that. I knew nothing about graduate school. He did not enlighten me. So, when he said, ""stay here,"" I thought nothing of it and was a bit relieved because that meant I could continue to live at home and cut down on expenses since I was going to be paying for this out of my own savings and perhaps loans.  Had I better advice, I might have applied to a better program with someone who had better grounding in the specific area that I wanted to study.  

Likewise, the semester before I defended my master's thesis, the semester in which most master's student would be applying to a doctoral program if they were in my position, other students asked me where I would apply. I didn't know that I should, which was when I learned that three degrees from the same school, especially a place like UH, is not the best career plan. I asked a couple of other faculty about it, and they told me the same. So, I went to him for advice. He grew furious and demanded to know who would dare tell me this. Meanwhile, he was doing all he could to help a male graduate student apply to Cornell and Columbia. That same student he helped get funding to travel to archives for his master's thesis but told me that I did not need to go to archives for research. Another professor said that he would never pass a master's thesis if the student had not gone to an archive and, although that professor would have been a perfect person to sit on my committee, my harasser would not allow him to sit on it for that reason. 

Up to this point, I've only been describing the unethically bad advice that this person gave me. The sexual harassment part is almost laughably mundane and cliché. It began with meetings at lunch time. Could I meet at noon? Oh, hey, it's lunch time! Am I hungry? Let's go get something to eat at the faculty cafeteria. He'll pay. Oh, it's crowded. How about off-campus? That sort of thing. Then, he wanted to meet after class, which ended at 9 pm. He'd close the blinds, although we were on the sixth floor. He'd shut the door. He'd want to meet in his ""secret office"" without windows. His shoulder had a cramp, could I rub it. How about his back? Here, sit on his lap. Really! Sit on his lap. Suggestions about my clothing, about the way that I buttoned the top button on my shirt, or that my skirts were so long, or so short, or that I didn't wear heels, or did. Complaints about his wife and the way she didn't understand him. Complaints about how much he did for everyone and was never appreciated -- ""all I get is a dick up my ass,"" was the way he put it. I'm not kidding.  He even gave me a box of chocolate kisses on Valentine's Day and said that he hoped it was full of orgasms.These things came gradually, in a crescendo, moving me from student, to friend, to confidante, to -- I don't know -- schoolyard crush in our interactions.

At the same time, he issued steady reminders that, if I did not accept the role, there were consequences. Those comments about being unappreciated contained stories that seemed to me veiled threats. For instance, he said that one student had not thanked him sufficiently in the acknowledgements of his thesis and therefore he would not help that student in job searches or other recommendations in the future. In another instance, he had learned that another, female student (who was quite pregnant at the time) has passed her comprehensive exams. He called her into his office and said something like ""let me give you a hug in congratulations."" According to him, she backed of. He said that one move told him that he disgusted her and that he was never going to help her with her career, write her a letter of recommendation, or get her dissertation published. So, this told me that I was supposed to publically praise him and allow him to touch me or he would not do the things an advisor was supposed to do in helping a student. Other little micro threats like this cropped up constantly in his disparaging of other students and faculty. 

Meanwhile, as my advisor, he made sure that I took classes only from him unless absolutely necessary, then only from junior faculty who would not contradict him. He had me do independent studies with him, working on a project as his research assistant, with the promise that the project would result in a publication. Yet, somehow, at the end of the semester, each time, the publication would not materialize because he would have to ""put the project on the back burner,"" and I would not have advanced much in my own research or education. I later learned that this was his modus operandi for his targets, simply to keep them from taking classes from other professors while also earning the requisite number of credits.

Two incidents happened when I knew that I could not deny what was going on. The first came one summer, during the last of those independent study classes. 
There was a weird incident involving a long-time, disturbed graduate student who had submitted an epic poem instead of a dissertation and certain aspects of this poem could easily be interpreted as death threats on the lives of several faculty members, including the harasser. The harasser took to meeting students at a restaurant just off campus frequented by police. That is, until the time came for my meeting. Then, he decided that he had been there too long and was too regular in his movements. He had to throw the would-be assassin off. He wanted to meet at this restaurant elsewhere. 

As I got out of my car in the parking lot and headed toward the door of the new restaurant, the harasser got out of his and said, ""hey, how about over here?"" He pointed to an unmarked door under a stairway on the side of a the building. Meanwhile, two people got out of separate cars in the parking lot, looked about, joined one another, and went in that door, as if perhaps they shouldn't be. ""There's supposed to be a bar over here that the graduate students go to,"" he said. I reminded him that I didn't drink and that I'd rather go to the restaurant, but he went over to the door and walked in. Like a sheep I followed him. 

The only place to sit was on sofas. He pestered me to order alcohol, although he ordered a non-alcoholic beer. I only ordered a Diet Coke. He kept moving away from the subject of the research project and skirting towards sexual topics. I was wearing walking shorts (down to my knees, it was Houston in the summer, after all), a t-shirt, and a long sleeve shirt as a jacket. He suggested that I loosen up and show off a bit more, then he reached over and moved my outer shirt over and peered down at my chest.  I covered myself up and said that I was fine just the way I was. His whole demeanor changed. He was clearly insulted. 

More than that, after that incident, his evaluation of my work, my intelligence, my abilities altered drastically. No longer was I a promising student making excellent progress. I was now lazy and without an analytical mind. He demanded that I take my comprehensive exams three semesters earlier in my program than any other student and before I had finished my coursework, otherwise, he said, I'd be lagging behind and he could do nothing for me. 

The second incident took place when I decided on a dissertation topic. I brought it to him, but it quickly became apparent that he did not want to talk about the topic. He wanted me to grovel to him. He told me that, if I were to continue to be his student I would have to do everything he said, not just taking the classes he said and following the instructions that he issued, but that I could not date, I could not have friends that he did not approve of, I could not talk to people who me did not approve of, and so on and so forth in a litany of control that astounded me. I knew that I had to get out of there no matter what. So, I told him that I would be finding a new advisor. I had no idea what I was going to do, but I walked out the door, down the hall, into another professor's office, and begged him to take me on, which he did, to his own peril. Shortly thereafter, I lost funding, and the harasser was and had been for many years the head of the committee who allocated the very limited t.a. positions. 

I later found out many things had been going on behind the scenes. He had ensured that one of the graduate students whom I was dating lost his funding. He golfed with another graduate student and engaged in all sorts of locker room talk about me on the links. He would tell other students or faculty that I was a flake and not very bright. He told me that he wrote a critical evaluation of me, but when I saw that evaluation it was not critical. He threatened other faculty away from me when he saw me speaking with them. He threatened my second advisor when my second advisor tried to advocate for me. When the entire committee decided to reinstate my funding, he went into an apoplectic fit until they relented and did not. The glowing acknowledgement that he had intimidated me into writing he then used as evidence that he could not have harassed me. He told people that I ""showed up"" at lunch time to trick him into taking me to lunch, when he had made the appointments, and otherwise painted me as someone with a poor sense of boundaries.  So, all while he was telling me that I was brilliant, he was telling everyone else that I was crazy and stupid.  When I found that out, that's exactly what I felt. 
",Graduate student,"My graduate advisor, a powerful, full professor in the department.",R2,University of Houston (which is now R1),History,,"First, other faculty and students told me to get away from him, find another advisor or go to another school. This was difficult because he had isolated me and undermined my confidence in myself and because other faculty did not want to incur his wrath. I did find another advisor, which entailed a change of specialization on my part. This new advisor had much less influence in the department or field because he was early in his own career. He ended up caught between his own fear of the harasser and defending me.  Fortunately, an allied department hired an older, more powerful faculty member who was able to maintain independence and who was happy to take care of me as a student. Meanwhile, when I suspected that the harasser had been retaliating against me, ensuring that my funding (t.a. position) was revoked and preventing me from securing any other funding, I filed a complaint with the Affirmative Action Office. The policy of that office was to interview me, distill my complaint into a one page memo, allow him to respond in as many pages as he needed (he took fourteen,  single-spaced), weigh the two, and decide if there was a case to pursue. As you can imagine, they decided ""no case."" The acting head of the AAO was interim when I made my complaint and, before his response came in, she began a little investigation that turned up at least two prior instances that resembled mine. By the time his response came in, she had been replaced with a permanent head (a man), who said that none of the information that the interim head had discovered could be used because she had not followed procedure. So, my case was filed away under my name but not under the harassers, as was their policy at the time. This was twenty years ago, and I've done quite well in spite of him. The best revenge is success. Still, I feel rage at all of the wasted emotion, the time lost to the migraines, the mental energy and hating myself. I resent the waste of my self. Plus, the damn school still can't address me as ""Dr."" when they ask for alumni donations. ","The closest to actual consequences that he suffered came first, when he was removed from the committee that decided graduate student funding after I filed the complaint, and, second, when he applied to be dean. A friend of mine worked for the head of the dean search committee. He asked her about the harasser and she mentioned the complaint I had filed. The search committee chair went down to the Office of Affirmative Action to take a look and found not just my file but, so she said, others. He was axed from their list. Otherwise, nothing happened to them. He's still known as the department harasser, even by others who have their own reputations as harassers. ","Well, obviously I would have gone to better graduate institutions had he not given me such colossally bad advice in the first place. Who knows where I might have ended up had I studied under an actual specialist at a better university where they had some basic ethics in graduate education? That said, after twenty years,  I've gotten my revenge through success. This wasn't always the case. I had to change advisors, twice, and I had to change fields, after already choosing a dissertation topic that could not translate from the early modern era to the nineteenth century. I lost funding, which meant taking on part-time jobs in addition to adjunct work in order to pay the bills and to pay the full tuition because teaching assistants also had a tuition waiver. I did not trust the advisor that I ended up with, nor really anyone at all by then, and therefore did not develop the sort of professional relationship that would have benefitted my early career. Because of that, I took a detour into library science that did little but put me into debt and teach me that I am, in fact, a historian and must rebuild a historian's career several years out of grad school. I have only recently earned tenure at age fifty, when I earned my PhD at age 33. The explanation for that, and the better answer to this question comes with the answers to the next two, because my mental health and the choices that I made that affected the trajectory of my life and career were direct and indirect consequences of this harassment. ","I am naturally depressive. I was in therapy and taking Prozac before the harassment, but doing very well, so well that I thought I did not need it any more. Because of my improvement, I had made the decision to go to graduate school and to become a historian. I had developed a sense of myself as smart -- maybe not brilliant, but capable and an intellectual. I respected my harasser as a scholar, and his cultivation of me as his student made me feel more confident. When I realized that his interest in me was prurient, that he called me ""flaky"" and ""an idiot"" to other graduate students but said I had ""great tits"" and wanted to ""see what's under that top button,"" that he wanted to help my male colleagues go on to better doctoral programs but became infuriated when I asked if I should be doing the same thing, that he would ruin my career if I didn't let him touch me, then my whole sense of my intelligence, analytical ability, judgement, and future collapsed. 

During this time, I ended up in not one, but three successive abusive personal relationships, tried to join the Army as an escape (they rejected me because of the Prozac -- thank goodness!). When I lost my funding and then realized that my second advisor was at risk because of his association with me, I became suicidal and began cutting myself. Throughout, I had migraines roughly twice a month, bad ones that lasted several days in a row. Then, the shame. Oh, the shame would not end. Shame for getting myself into that in the first place. Shame for denying it for so long. Shame for not reporting it the minute that I knew that it was what it was. Shame and guilt that, in not reporting it, I had left some other woman vulnerable. Shame that perhaps I was the only one stupid enough to have fallen into that situation. Shame that I was sure everyone who did know thought I was crazy or asking for it or blowing it out of proportion. Honestly, writing this down now, I don't know how I got through it except for those fantastic therapists at the student health and counseling center, more Prozac, feminism, and making friends with a new cohort of graduate students.","This one is complicated because I don't want to make it sound like this was a good experience. It was awful. Yet, as Carrie Fisher said, ""take your broken heart and turn it into art."" I was a naïve, middle class, white girl with almost no understanding of the way power works. The whole experience cured me of that, from the way he used his power over me and over people associated with me to the way that people on the margins of my story had to judge the cost of tangling with him to the way that the institution protected itself in the process of reporting to the way that I myself became tainted by the harassment not only as it happened, but after and since. Someone told me that I can never charge someone with harassment again after this because then people will think the problem is with me, not with the harasser. That is patriarchy. 

Thus, the experience brought me to feminism, and feminism taught me compassion with marginalized people in ways that I never explored. That influenced my scholarship and put me in contact with some amazing people I might otherwise have missed, so I'm a better historian than I ever would have been under his alleged tutelage.

 But, I was also so very jaded by academia, just completely disgusted. If I could have done anything else and still been a historian, I would have. In fact, I did try. I finished my PhD simply because I felt I had earned it through grief but they don't give it to you until you finish your dissertation. Then, I didn't look for a faculty job. I was just trying to figure out my next move when I found a document editing job, which was great. That boss was awful, harassing in a different way, but I was also ultra-sensitive because of my prior experience. When we lost funding for the second time in four years, I got a library science degree, but discovered that I was too much of a storyteller and researcher of my own interests (rather than others') to be happy there, so found my way back to the academic world via community colleges.

 Now I'm at a liberal arts college. I also got my dissertation published, wrote a short, touristy book, and an academic trade press book in the meantime, all because I wanted to rather than had to. I found my own voice, but all in spite of the harassment. I could probably have done more in my life, and in a straighter line had I not been so angry and bitter and consumed shame. I'd probably be closer to retirement, for sure. I'd be further along, and maybe with more options in this uncertain academic environment. 

Twenty years offer many contingencies and the historical context has changed. Young women coming up have so much more facing them that, if we transplanted my experiences to today, I don't think that someone in my position could really recover from them. The environment in academia, regardless of gender, is too unforgiving of anything but a straight trajectory that the slightest wobble can devastate a career. A predator will do more than wobble you.",Thank you for doing this.,Male
12/4/2017 14:38:11,"I was a second year in graduate school and my PI, who is a serial narcissistic abuser sought to control my entire life sending countless texts and emails to monitor my whereabouts, not allowing me to go on vacation because ""I hadn't earned it"" etc. The sexual harassment came in the place of pressure for me to break up with a boyfriend I had at the time as well as other unwanted comments about how I dressed in lab. He would discourage me from eating lunch with my boyfriend and harass me when he noticed we were hanging out together. In a private meeting he said to me ""I know you're always coming in late because of you and your boyfriends extracurricular activities,"" referring to having sex before coming to work. It's a long and awful story really but long story short, he harassed me until I broke up with my boyfriend and moved closer to lab. He threatened to fire me every day unless I did whatever it was he was wanting me to do- cancel my vacation time, sleep in lab. ""If it were me, I would have slept her until the results came out. How can I make you care that much?"" When I stared to fight back and stand up for myself, he lied to my committee about me misrepresenting my work in order to have me dismissed from the program. I fought this using recordings of conversations and other evidence of the emotional abuse and after threatening to sue, the assistant dean of the graduate school intervened and made a pathway for me to stay in the program but I was already at my wit's end and decided to leave anyway which likely saved my life. I had worked so hard to get my PhD from this #1 program and he had me wrapped so tightly around his finger that I nearly attempted suicide. After I left, three other women in my lab left without the PhD they came there for and I do not doubt it was because of this PIs inappropriate behavior. I still suffer from PTSD and associated issues from the 2 years I spent being abused by this man. The worst part is that even though he lost 5 students in five years they still awarded him tenure (I was one f his first students). In this particular program abuse is not only the norm but is encouraged because his fellow professors (all white men) only encouraged his behavior and when I tried to reach out for help, they discouraged me from seeking help even from a mediator who would help our meetings. As bad as my experience was, I witnessed far worse things happening to my fellow students in other labs. ",Graduate student,my PI ,Elite Institution/Ivy League,MIT ,Chemistry,,No one would even meet with me until I threatened to sue for discrimination (3 black students had gone into this lab and all 3 including myself did not make it out).

","I essentially had to leave chemistry. I simultaneously want to go into academia in order to be a resource for students like myself but fear that as a black woman it will be impossible especially given the fact that I have suffered setbacks in my current project due to mental health difficulties caused by my experience. Ive had to set really strict boundaries with my current PI and people I work with to avoid being triggered, especially by texts and emails and personal meetings in small offices which has been really awkward because I just want to be a normal student who is able to have fun with my coworkers. ","Thank you for doing this survey. I had no idea that what happened to me was abuse until I took an ethics class a few years later and saw a text book list of all the unethical things a PI could do and realized that if each of them hadn't happened to me- I'd witnessed it happening to another student. Even a year ago I would never have opened up about this experience, even anonymously for fear of retribution because my PI had already done so much to blacken my reputation. After he was promoted despite hurting my fellow students and friends (one woman toiled for 4.5 years under this man before deciding that if she didn't leave she might kill herself) I really felt like I couldn't be silent anymore.

12/4/2017 15:01:11,"Two. As a first year doctoral student, I was propositioned at a professional conference by a prominent, senior scholar in my field-he acted as if he was interested in my research interests and then tried to get me to go with him to his hotel room to spend the night. I demurred and really had to keep giving excuses until he finally took no for an answer. Given his status, I was certain that there would be professional repercussions in the future. I still see him at conferences and professional meetings: twice a year minimum over the last 25 years or so, which is of course very uncomfortable. The second instance, in my first years as a new faculty member I was also subject to harassing comments by a senior colleague  in my department. It was finally so bad and was happening in front of my students, I spoke to my dean. He encouraged me not to speak to HR but to have a sit-down in his office, with the perp and an ally of the perp. My colleague was shocked that I had been offended and promised reform. He was much more careful in how he spoke to me in public; interestingly, my dean had no trouble with (making sure that?) the perp was on the faculty evaluation committee when I went up for tenure. The perp made sure to make ""off handed comments"" around me about the power he wielded on the committee so that I was terrified about my prospects for tenure. I was worried that had I spoken up officially or gone to HR at that point, there would be gossip that I was not qualified for tenure and that this was my way of gaming the system (not true) or that I would be detested for going against everyone's favorite good old boy and that that would also lead colleagues to think I was not ""collegial."" Either way, it seemed to me that I would lose by speaking up. So I didn't do anything but ask the provost that I hoped my application would be fully read and vetted by more than just one or two people on the committee.  She assured me my application would be read thoroughly and I did receive tenure. Thereafter, the perp was very mean spirited to me in public contexts and undermining in every way but did not cross a line explicitly that could get him in trouble. He created an extremely stressful work environment. ",One as a new PhD student.

They also informed me that it was not just sexual harassment but abuse of power through dominating control and ego issues.

12/4/2017 18:19:30,"2011: One of my professors in graduate school infamously slept with his students, grad and undergrad alike. I confronted him by saying that I thought he would want to know that grad students were buzzing with gossip about his exploits and the student he was sleeping with at the time would come to class and tell people all about what they had been up to. When I spoke to him, he looked and the ground and said, ""Thanks"" -- then he cut me off professionally, never to speak to me again. He  broke up with this particular student shortly after my confrontation and used my name *while he was still inside of her* in a post-coital ""this isn't working out"" move. He would go on to sleep with several other students while I was in school (and after). This behavior established a value system that confused the metrics for ""good work,"" created competition between women that had nothing to do with the program or our education, and normalized predatory behavior. Of course he has been promoted several times and never held accountable even though his antics are widely known. 

2011: My advisor commented on my breasts in a meeting about my thesis. This was part of a comment  he was making about why he didn't understand that the professor who slept with students was seeing/interested in a friend/colleague of mine who, according to my advisor was less attractive than me ""because [my] breasts [we]re so much larger than hers"". This was completely unprompted, of course. 

2011-2013 I started dating a man who was a year ahead of me in my grad program who serially harassed my friends by constantly crossing boundaries, not accepting no for an answer, and groping them (sometimes in front of me, sometimes not) while we were together. Of course this means that he harassed me, too. We were together for about six months when he moved to the east coast to attend a PhD program from which he was expelled for groping a woman's genitals at an off campus party. Because they were both in the same PhD program, she was able to levy charges. The University suspended him, and after the term was up they took away his funding, but did not require him to leave the program. He quit when the money ran out. During this time of crisis, he turned to me to perform the emotional labor of supporting him without revealing all of the details of what had gone down. After a couple of years, he moved back to where I lived and began adjuncting at the institution where we met. Not only did the faculty support him during his suspension (he reached out to the professor who slept with students to ask for advice), but they hired him back to work in their department knowing fell well of his transgressions, the charges filed, and his 'fall from grace' in the PhD program he moved across the country to attend.",What does this question mean?

We invited Lester Spense to be our keynote speaker for this event, and I was incredibly excited to talk to him about his work since I respect it so much. The first day I met him, I was excitedly talking about a new book that had just come out, and how it intersected with his work and my own when he interrupted me and asked ""Do you have a partner that helps you with this?"" I was confused and hurt, and responded ""um, absolutely not. I do all of my own work."" He replied ""I'm trying to ask if you're single or not, that's all."" I didn't know what to do since I was shocked for several reasons: one being that he is very public about his marriage and his children, and two, because I was caught off guard. This was the first of many incidents that week with him. I kept trying to keep my other male-identified friends around me, but they also did not understand what the big deal was. I told the group at one point ""Lester Spense keeps trying to sleep with me,"" and my ""friend"" said ""awesome, you should do it!"" I was heartbroken, because once again, they didn't understand what it's like to never be asked about your work, but instead treated like someone who is just there to have sex with.

He lied to me and told me he was getting divorced. I told my friends I didn't want him in my car, and the other event organizer said ""god dammit just take him to xxx's house.""

I have also been denied access to departmental funds to take students on excavations (2000-present). Though there is one incident that I always report. I was called an 'hysterical feminist bitch' by a male colleague in 2003. He took credit for the development of a new MA, for which we were both designing,  in front of a group of students. He said 'my MA that I am so hard at work on'.  I said, that's 'we are doing it'. Just after the team taught class he screamed (I am not exaggerating) at me saying that I should never embarrass him in front of students. I responded that he should give credit to people for the work they are doing. His response was 'it's not important and you are behaving like an hysterical feminist bitch'. I turned my back on him, walked away, and I went to our university HR, but I was still on academic probation, and was told it's his word against mine, and there will be trouble for me, not him.  Given my status as a young lecturer (Assistant Professor), I didn't have any support. Fortunately this person is in a different department from mine and that was the last day I ever spoke to him or taught with him. He continues to damage women in the University.

This is further evinced by another colleague's actions that have been continuous since he joined the university in 2007. This colleague has gotten away with sending slanderous emails about colleagues (various genders, no one is safe) that are unfounded to the entire department, school and to members of the University executive group. There are yearly, if not monthly, complaints made to HR about his behaviour, but it was only when men started complaining that action is beginning to be taken, though even this is slow. ","For the feminist bitch comment, it was a wake up call that there is no support, so I didn't let that 'get to me', my objective is to tell everyone I meet about it to warn them about the person and the university. I have been a victim of the email harassment I described in the previous section three times. The first time it happened I couldn't eat and lost ten pounds, I went to HR because I had proof in writing, but they did nothing. The second and third time, I didn't let it get to me, but went to HR both times, they did nothing and told me I was overreacting. I was overreacting to someone stating in an email to the entire school that I had no skills to contribute to archaeological excavation and didn't deserve departmental funds to take my students on excavations (I've had more digging experience then said person, who basically ruined his excavation just outside Rome and is banned from digging at that site, and have written books on the subject with reputable publishers: Cambridge, Brill).

12/5/2017 4:44:46,"Two incidents. 1. 1980s: I was a grad student and an extremely famous visiting scholar whose class I was taking body-blocked his office door and pressured me to come back to his lodgings one night. Something similar happened to the other woman grad student in the class. There were reporting procedures in place for faculty who harassed undergrads, but not grad students, at the time, and it was not entirely uncommon for faculty and grad students to become involved.  When I told my mentors in the dept. -- all women -- they 'tsked' and said it was a shame but just to do my best work in the class and hope for a good grade.  In the end, he gave everyone in the class the same grade without, evidently, having read the papers. (I should say, however, that harassment was so common for women at the time, I finally just shrugged the incident off. Recently, however, when I attempted to tell fellow academics about it, some -- including women -- reacted with denial, saying they could not believe that the scholar would do that, both because it contradicted his politics and because he later became involved with a man.) 2. Late 1990s: I had my first job, a visiting appointment.  The new department chair, appointed from another university, took an evidently unusual liking to me, appointed me to committees and positions inappropriate for a visitor, and told me that if I did well in these he would try to arrange a tenure-track job. I had come from a working-class background where I was used to this kind of thing at jobs and didn't realize that it was not proper academic procedure. He made remarks strongly implying to fellow faculty that we were having an affair. I tried to imply back that this was no so, but did not feel free to say anything that would upset him. They treated me very poorly. An added complication was that a few key woman faculty members appeared to be highly jealous, as he was considered very dashing, as well as understandably resentful of this special treatment -- though I had not asked for it and didn't know what to do about it. I went to a compliance officer, and was told that I could file a report, but that it would very likely be damaging to my career; this seemed true, so I didn't. In the end, he did try to arrange a tenure-track appointment; the rest of the department quietly rebelled; he was made to step down as chair for other reasons; my visiting appointment was ended a year early due to 'budgetary considerations'; and I was forced to leave for another -- thankfully, much better and saner -- visiting job elsewhere. (Here I should make a caveat as well. I do not believe that he realized what he was doing was harassment. He seemed genuinely to feel that I was a person of special ability -- or to project that upon me -- and that we were beginning a meaningful working, and romantic, relationship.  His last relationship had been with one of this grad students, who then became his colleague, elsewhere. At the new institution, he said, he felt lonely and misunderstood. Because I did not feel myself in a position to tell him what I really felt, he took my politeness as confirmation. I say this not to defend him in any possible way but to slightly nuance such situations, in which the powerful do not view their imposition as one of force or violence, but are rather unable to see that it is inappropriate to use underlings to fulfill their physical and/or emotional needs.  I also believe that this explains why so much of this behavior is generationally-bound -- that younger faculty may have more cultural awareness. I would also like to say, however, that I feel complicit in having accepted special treatment on this basis, though. The flip side to harassment no one's talking about is unfairness to those passed over for opportunities in favor of the direct target. Not to victim-blame; however -- as Laura Kipnis argues in a recent New York Review of Books piece rather sharper than some of her previous works -- women are not children. As long as some stand to benefit from playing into traditional gender roles, or passively fail to  resist them, objectification -- dehumanization of women into both 'attractive' and 'unattractive' or 'repulsive' objects, the first both rewarded and imperiled; the second imperiled in different ways -- women will simply be reinforcing the system.)",1.

In the final review he smugly wrote in my evaluation as a criticism of me that I had fewer women participating in my class (there were something like 23 male students and 2-3 female students in this particular class), but did not bother to note the ways in which I encouraged the participation of the few women to specifically mitigate that imbalance.

I dismissed it as odd, but looking back, that was a GIGANTIC red flag - why would you even think to say that?
A casual friendship progressed to constantly asking me out through many ""no""s. He would corner me in an empty hallway and tell me how beautiful I was, and that I'd regret not going on a date with him, details of his current (evidently prolific) sex life and how he'd pull younger women (I was 26 and he was 40).  My dismissal of his interest just made him come on stronger.  The most egregious incident was after I went to lunch with him; he tried to kiss me in the parking lot of the school, in the close quarters of his car.  I pushed him away; he's 6'7"" and muscular, so I consider myself lucky that he didn't push further than that.  
He claimed another employee had a crush on him and was jealous of me. I have no idea if this was true; I do know he was using the story to try to emphasize how ""lucky"" I was that he was paying me attention, i.e. that SOME women would fall over backwards for him, but he was choosing ME.  He emphasized that last part rather often; that despite all the other women he was seeing and bedding, he'd drop them for me in an instant.
I had heard from other women that he was known for this sort of thing, though I don't know to what extent.  I know he had asked out my predecessor as well; she had warned me.  It's one of the reasons I never reported it to the school - I knew he was more valuable to them than I was, so why bother. (For-profit school, awful corporate administration.) I was at this school less than a year (2014), so all this occurred in a pretty compressed timeframe.
He got engaged and brought in his new fiancee shortly before I left; I still wonder if maybe he had been dating her the whole time, which in some ways adds another layer of ""yikes"" to the whole thing.

A member of the staff (quasi-faculty, non-tenured) whose role was conceptualized as outreach (Director of a national non-profit located within an academic program, which virtually all organizations focused on the discipline belong to) became notably obsessed with a former grad assistant and current grad assistant of his supervisor.  The behavior was not overtly threatening, and he consulted me about his ""crush"" on one of the two. He was also dating a friend of mine at the time.  His supervisor asked me about it eventually, as did his girlfriend, because he told them/me about efforts to engage both parties, including eventually asking the graduate assistant to his boss out and being rejected, but continuing to make reasons to talk to, address, work with, and so on the assistant.  There was gossip about him ""leering"" at the assistant, and he and his girlfriend had a fight about the former assistant, when he tricked her into going to a concert at which he knew both the current and former assistants would be there, at which he was highly focused on the two assistants and not on his girlfriend. His girlfriend told me she felt he was ""obsessed"" with both, and told me after the concert incident that she felt he might be stalking them.  I was later told that the current assistant had told her boss that she was uncomfortable, and asked that provisions be made for her to avoid him.  Unfortunately, he was in the office well beyond standard business hours, and their offices were near each other, so this required her to shift her focus somewhat from in-office work to field work, and to work in the office only when others could be present.

This is not to say #NotAllProfs but just to say that having to think about those questions made me reflect: if I *had* been harassed, what would I have done? We now have staff (and one faculty member) who have put themselves forward as being ""safe spaces,"" having undergone some kind of formal training towards such, for students who might have been harassed or belittled; but the one faculty member isn't tenured and the staff is, unsurprisingly, low in the hierarchy, so if I were harassed and reported it to them I wouldn't honestly expect anything productive to come out of the event. The other aspect of my program I'm thinking of: I'm currently a GRA for a multi-prof writing project, and the participants--who all know each other, and are all tenured--routinely blow off deadlines and generally treat each other, in actions if not in words, with contempt. And I'm thinking: if it's that hard to police something as simple as ""you need to get the portion of the paper by me to X date,"" how on earth are we going to police stuff like harassment? I feel like the academia-as-a-cult metaphor might be useful here: thinking about how hard it can be to call out bad behavior within the cult (or, if ""cult"" is too pejorative a word, tightly-knit group--the church organization, the small town, the we're-all-in-this-together small business, etc.) might shed some light on how to restructure academia so that bad behavior is punished and potential bad behavior is discouraged. I mean, I would never correct a victim of harassment or assault (which is to say, me and almost every woman I know) if she wanted to talk about ""toxic masculinity,"" but I think that the framework of toxic masculinity, as important as it is to talk about, doesn't quite get at solving the problem, which may have more to do with social hierarchies and demonstrating power within the group. (I.e. if you can violate group norms *and get away with it*, you have demonstrated your power to the larger group. In this way it might actually *benefit* harassing and/or misogynistic professors to have whisper networks spring up around them--everybody knows that they're the assholes, and everybody knows that no one's apparently powerful enough to stop them from being assholes.)

--The silver lining: I became more independent in research and pledged to become a role model in academia so that young women in the next generations would never be as alone as I had been.","I suspect the scale of sexual harassment in North American academia is enormous. And it also has taken a terrible toll, even for those who rode the ferris wheel to the top. So many of us lost confidence that our professors were interested in our ideas, our writing, our research. Many of us even bought into myths--perpetrated by these predators and their enablers--that we had provoked them with our demeanor or that they were sex-starved from having devoted their youths to their oh-so-brilliant careers. But this harassment was never about anything we did. And it was certainly not about sex. It was about the extent to which they were doing everything in their power to ensure their privilege would not be threatened by people who were shifting the goalposts on what research was valued in academia. So long as we were afraid to be alone in their office hours, to go to their homes,  to ask much of them in terms of advising or mentoring, their power within the university was intact. If we could be silenced about their peccadilloes, wouldn't it also be easy to demand silence when they voted against giving fellowship support to women, LBGT people, and POC--or when they wrote against us for tenure and promotions? Out of these silences came many tragedies of complicity that will haunt academia for years to come.",Male

We share similar speech/debate/academic circles. He was my mentor -- he wrote me a glowing letter of recommendation to two of my universities. He's married and I have discouraged him from these types of highly charged messages. I have sought to redirect his amorous attention back to his marriage. I would like to preserve this mentorship/friendship, and have tried to be empathetic to circumstances which might be leading him to seek out sexual fulfillment in me. However, this has really damaged my view of him and has negatively impacted me. I've started to wonder if I he wrote my letters of recommendation because he was sexually attracted to me and does this mean I'm not fit for academic work?

This graduate student told me that there was a group outing for the REU students happening and that he could drive me over from the lab. I didn't know anyone else yet, and I believed him that there was an event. He lied; there was no such event, and I ended trapped with him in a bad part of town that didn't have any public transportation (this was before uber). I was a 19-year-old summer intern without a car. He put his arm around me and ushered me around, forcing me to go with him to various spots. I was very uncomfortable and told him I wanted to go back, because he was my only ride out. I had him drop me off a distance from where I lived, but he followed me back to my apartment, where he kissed me and wouldn't let go of me. I had to use all of my strength to force him off of me and literally ran away from him and locked the door. I told my direct supervisor about it, who told me that I was being unfair to him and that I should go on a date with him after all that effort that he went to. My direct supervisor, a grad student, also told me in private (in the cleanroom) that he thought that women did not belong in science as they (we) were not naturally good at it. He said that he thought women were better suited to cooking and cleaning.

12/5/2017 14:36:51,"Numerous incidents with several male faculty.  One stands out as the worst, but the others were just as worthy of being written here. I will stick with this one: A tenured professor repeatedly came to my office taking up increasingly large amounts of my time talking about nothing, trying to get me to talk about my ""feelings"" and my childhood, and repeatedly talking about his as a way of asking me about mine.  After trying to get the person to back off in nice-ish ways, such as by saying that I had a lot of work to do (this did not stop the person), I had to begin asking this professor more bluntly to please back off a bit, such as by talking about professional and personal boundaries and how I needed him to respect these. The professor did not stop. He flooded me with emails, most of which were bizarre and prying emails. If I did not answer them soon after they were sent (and they were sent not just during the work week but at nights and on weekends as well), then he would then come to my office and insist that we talk / have a long discussion about this --i.e., about why I did not answer his emails, about what my feelings were about his emails, and about how he was hurt that I had not answered. When I tried to avoid these meetings by insisting that he respect work/professional boundaries he also started insisting that he had no idea what ""my"" boundaries were, that the only way he could know this was to test them, and so I *had* to answer his questions about my feelings. he continued to send me inappropriate emails and to visit to my office and demand long periods of my time. Some of these emails said things like: he wanted to start a fan club for me, he wanted to work together with me on academic articles, he wanted to do a book reading club with me (so that I would have to spend endless amounts of time talking with him about some book), and did I like/would I accept hugs..... Since nothing was working and he kept insisting he could not know what *my* boundaries were, I had to make them very clear: I outlined in an email that I would not answer his emails on the weekends or at night, that I would not answer any emails that were not strictly work related, and that --since there was really absolutely nothing we needed to email about relating to work-- I did not want to receive more than one email from him a week.  I also said that I probably would not be able to answer this email right away, and that he needed to accept that it may take me a day or so to get back to him.  He flipped out and tried to tell me that the whole reason I had gotten the job was because HE pushed for me to be hired, and the whole reason he had done this was because he thought that he and I were going to be good friends. He had thought I was one of those people he could really connect with, and he was so hurt. And he was angry that he had been mistaken about this....etc. He sort of threw a tantrum. For the first week after this he did send me a single email.  The second week I received no contact from him at all, and I thought finally I had managed the situation. But the third week he stopped me in the hallway to say that I had not answered his last email. Confused, I told him that I had. It turned out that he had sent me an email the second week, but he sent it to the wrong address (to a student's address).  Because I had not received it, he reforwarded it to me, then also sent me another email. Both of these emails had nothing to do with work, but were all about his feelings around this new situation. He also printed out an additional letter and shoved it under my door. AND he put a card in my mail box with Hershey's ""kisses"" and ""hugs"" taped to it. This was all within the span of 2 or 3 days. And then, when I did not respond to any of these, he called me on the phone in my office (from his office) to find out why I was not responding.  I had to go to the department chair for advice. And things just got worse from there.",Visiting Assistant Professor,"Much older, tenured professor",Other R1,Rochester Institute of Technology,Social Sciences,,"(1) The chair at the time ORDERED me to file an HR complaint against this faculty member. I was a Visiting Assistant Professor. Women on my committee told me to NOT file a complaint or it would make me seen as a liability and end my career.  I was pressured and harassed by HR people with repeated calls over a period of weeks, with them trying to make me file and with my chair ""ordering"" me to file. Neither my chair nor HR told me that filing was optional (though I knew they could not make me do it).  My chair also ""ordered"" me to go see a counselor at the Center for Gender and... something else.  I told him that I was not sure I wanted to do that and he told me this was not optional, it was required.  My chair also ""ordered"" me to print out all of my email communications with this professor and to write up a summary of all of the office visits I had had. I did these things, and I visited the campus Center on Gender.... but I did not file a complaint.  There were multiple issues of harassment and discrimination at this university that impacted me (it turns out --I was told-- that there were several lawsuits against this institution at the time, including --again, I was told-- a class action lawsuit for sexual harassment and sexual/racial discrimination. I was also told that at least one student had filed a complaint against this professor, but nothing was done.). 

Later, I had another problem with another male faculty member who came to my office and would not leave. This faculty member was not tenure-track, but he now has a tenure track job.

I also had a problem with a separate male faculty member who expected me to do all of the work on a campus event we were supposed to be organizing together, but then to allow him to take all of the credit. I did everything, particularly bringing the speakers and attendees to the event; but he claimed he had done it all (he didn't even know the speakers, or anything about the topic of the event, so it was fine that he did not help any more than giving some of his budget to the event. It was problematic that he and the department chair told the Dean of the college that HE was the one who did it all, and therefore HE should be promoted to this or that position). This faculty member was not even in my department at the time. He was a lecturer in another department who had inherited a Native center on campus from a tenured professor who had left and arranged to have this professor run it. He was also friends with the chair who wanted to bring him --and his center-- into the department.  He is now in that department on a tenure-track line.

Still later I had another problem with a faculty member, a Research Professor who brought grant money into the university, who demanded that I use my personal Facebook connections with Native people in order to bring people out to his Symposium on Languages AND he wanted me to *make* one traditional Native leader that I knew show up at his event so that he could use that for positive event publicity. He did not want the Native leader to *speak* at his event, though this was a nationally respected leader for his language revitalization efforts.  Instead, he wanted this leader and all of my Native friends to come sit and listen to a bunch of academics talk and theorize about the revitalization efforts these people were already doing in their own communities. I told this professor that I did not think his requests were appropriate. I did ask him for more information on his Symposium, and I offered input on how to make the event more relevant to the people he wanted to attract. But he did not like this idea, did not give me any real information on his event, and then wound up complaining about me to the new department chair because of my lack of help. The department chair acted as if I was some huge problem because I would not act as a secretary and exploit all of my friends for the event this professor was organizing that had nothing to do with me. I had not been asked or agreed to help work on this event with this professor, and I hadn't even gotten any viable information on the event. Yet, the chair tried to end my contract because of this (!) and this Research Professor called a department meeting, inviting everyone but me, and then attacking me for alleged noncooperation, or whatever. I was told that the vast majority of other faculty members defended me against the chair and this Research Professor. But the first professor discussed above was allowed to speak to the other faculty in this meeting about my future at the institution, and he was allowed to tell them that he had had problems with me, and that I thought everyone in the department was a shark rather than a dolphin, and so I clearly had issues with perception....etc. 

I worked through the end of my contract, but my contract was not renewed. I did not want to be there any longer, anyway. But it is somewhat infuriating that I was basically demonized for not doing every inappropriate thing any male coworker demanded of me. 

The first, tenured professor kept his job.  The other three professors, who were all non-tenure track at the time, are now all in tenure track positions at the university.","Professor 1: no consequences.

","The situation caused me to doubt myself as a scholar because it felt like I would never be taken seriously. I was one of the top performers in class discussions & I received high marks in other classes with non-harassing professors. It’s also affected how I approach male faculty now that I’m married, as I feel I have to be selective in my word choice towards them. But in the end, I feel I’ve overcome most of that particular situation. Other instances, such as child molestation, abusive relationships & rape definitely affected me more significantly; but this situation, at school - which had always been my safe place & the place where I felt I could shine; I’d already completed two Masters prior to the degree I was pursuing at the time -  it struck a different chord.

I am an East Asian female graduate student, who began a close polyamorous relationship with a white male graduate student in my first year of studies (Fall 2015). He is three years senior to me, and is writing his dissertation on feminism. It started off as a good relationship, and he was only seeing me when we became involved. I had no reason not to trust him (he expressed very radical and progressive views on race, feminism, and sexuality), and was happy for him to begin seeing other people.

But in the short span of a few months, it slowly but surely escalated into a situation where he was (1) sleeping with two other East Asian women on campus, (2) had slept with two other East Asian women on trips overseas, and (3) was sexting a half-Asian woman who was in another country. Before meeting, he had also been involved with several Asian woman. One of them was an female undergraduate in philosophy he saw when he was already a graduate student, and their relationship ended terribly for her.

The fetishistic nature of all of this slowly got to me, and it was emotionally devastating as he was someone I had come to trust. Our relationship deteriorated and ended very badly. There was a lot of gaslighting involved, and many attempts to make me feel guilty and blame the other women involved, but I eventually realised that he was the one with the problem.

The relationship ended extremely badly, and I developed PTSD shortly afterwards. I was afraid to be on campus and in my department, for fear of seeing him and the other women on campus. He also lives right next to the department (his room can be seen a short distance away from the main entrance). The PTSD was debilitating, and has affected me from Spring 2016 to now (Fall 2017). It set back my work and personal life in many ways. Amongst other symptoms, I had multiple panic attacks daily. My mental health problems were exacerbated by my knowledge that he was literally being paid to do research on feminism.

As no crime or policy violation had been committed, the department could do nothing other than to offer me psychological support, and extensions on incomplete work. I am thankful for them.

I tried to end things once a week and he would go into hysterics contacting me, escalating in urgency and threats to hurt himself until I contacted him back.

12/5/2017 16:47:20,"I was a female PhD student who was also working full time. I still had office space in my academic department and shared the office with my supervisor's new post-doctoral student. This post-doc indicated interest in my PhD project as well as my external job. Often after work I would come into the office to work on my PhD and the post-doc would also be working. The post-doc suggested collaborating on a number of projects and I was very excited by the prospect of professional collaboration, as the research sounded very interesting and might lead to publications. The post-doc then thought that because we spent time together discussing research as well as personal matters and news/popular culture, and occasionally shared a meal in a public restaurant, that meant we were ""going out"", that I was his girlfriend; he repeatedly tried to put his arm around me or to hold hands with me. Every time this happened I said that I was not his girlfriend and that I wanted to keep the relationship professional. He said he would be going to another country for another postdoc and he asked me to join him after I was finished my PhD, so that we could collaborate. He said he would pay all expenses. He offered to help me finish my PhD by writing one or more chapters, and by paying my tuition. I declined his offer and reminded him that I was not his girlfriend. I told him that I was disappointed that he had turned a cordial professional relationship into something that made me very uncomfortable. I stopped doing my PhD work in the office unless I knew that he would not be there, and I tried to avoid him whenever possible. He left to do his other postdoc and much international traveling, and he kept sending me letters and gifts for years afterwards, from all over the globe. I never replied to or acknowledged his mail.

I am not concerned, but I do not understand why he continues to make contact; I have never replied to any of his mail or emails.

12/5/2017 19:15:58,"I am a Canadian who was hired at a university in Washington State as an Assistant Professor in Materials Science and Chemistry.  I found the transition from graduate school, which I found to be collegial and enjoyable, to the highly competitive world of American academia to be very difficult. Sometime in my second year at WSU I was reading one of Jane Goodal's books. I was sitting in a faculty when I suddenly realized that I was surrounded by a classic primate male dominance pecking order, and that I was the male at the bottom. Until I had arrived at WSU I had been a quite successful student and postdoc, so needless to say I found my new position to low status to be difficult. The department had quite dysfunctional dynamics at the time and quite a lot of energy was expended by the faculty making sure that everyone stayed in their place in the pecking order.  I did notice that the two women in the department were treated differently. They were not so much part of the pecking order, and for this I envied them. I simply wanted to be valued for who I was and to make a contribution. The environment was not encouraging and I often felt humiliated. I did not thrive this environment.   I left after four years.  After a lot of soul searching and with guidance from the book ""What Color is My Parachute"" I was able  to redirect my life. I have since had quite successful career in industry.

If one is looking for work-life balance and has variety of interests, then I now realize that academia is a poor choice of career, whether one is male or female. 

At the same time, I do feel that people in academia should be expected to work harder  than other people and for less money. They have the privilege of being able to focus on their life's work, rather than working for someone else.  But, if one does not have a life's work, then why bother, there are better things out there, I promise you.  I also think too much effort is expended on counting the numbers of different people from different demographic groups.  The focus should be on finding the most talented people, with a passion to pursue their interests despite the obstacles.   It turns out that it was not for me, but I do acknowledge that great human progress has been made by giving selected people (mostly, but not exclusively, men) the opportunity to pursue their interests to the exclusion of all else (e.g. Newton, Einstein, Stephen Hawkings, John Polanyi,  Margaret MacDonald, Jane Goodall, etc.).",,not sure it is relevant

I relented because the ex professor was very pushy and I did not want to jeopardise my relationship with him as he was a well known academic whose recommendation got people a place in Ivy Leagues.

12/6/2017 2:06:38,"False allegations of sexual harassment are sexual harassment. 

I was very surprised to be informed- in 1995, on a January Monday at 1:15 p.m.- that I was accused of two years of “ongoing and increasingly worsening sexual harassment” and that there was a request I be expelled from the school, this from five fellow female students at a small Canadian college. I was to attend a meeting the following morning at 9:15 in the “Executive Meeting Room,” according to the short handwritten note on the envelope I was provided, with eight pages enclosed, including four pages of sexual harassment allegations, signed by the women, and four pages of either college rules regarding sexual harassment and/or college procedure on dealing with such issues. 

The next morning, as I was seated alone in the hallway terminus, five fellow female students were led by me, by a sympathetic college staffer, who looked like a helpful aunt with a collection of flower girls before a wedding, as four of the women were dressed in white, toes to shoulders. The college staffer led them to an adjoining room to the large Board of Governors Chambers. 
I was led into chambers about five minutes later, by a college vice-president, who pointed a chair to me, his back to me as he walked, without pausing or breaking stride, in a gesture I thought at the time like a duck hunter would point orders to a hound. 

Again, the allegations comprised four typewritten pages signed by these women, all student journalists, one student editor, one advertising manager, and one friend- which was a shock to my then girlfriend. When I showed her the allegations her face went so white her freckles stood out. We locked eyes, trapped in the surreal nature of it all, in one concentrated moment. 
I had read the first page only by the time the hearing began. I thought the issue was so bizarre I would attend the meeting the following morning to find out what was going on. 
The reason why my girlfriend was shocked upon reading the allegations is that she met this friend, ***, the previous November, just two months prior. On that occasion *** came to the newspaper classroom office where I was working late, alone, about 7:00 p.m., my girlfriend seated beside me, waiting for me to finish typing out some project. We were journalism students, after all. *** asked if I was familiar with the trades wing of the college. I was. She said she had to cover a trades show and didn’t want to walk there by herself, and would I mind walking with her. I said sure. Students have the option of asking security to escort, but a friend does in a pinch. When I got to the newspaper office door, I turned to my girlfriend and suggested we all may as well go down. It was a bit of a hike, the long corridor in trades did look dimmer than during the day. We quickly discovered the proper door, and it was a full trade show inside, Snap-On Tools with a truck and tool display, Bear Instruments, others, a agriculture combine with a pexiglass side so viewers could see its workings, plus coffee and donuts. Once inside *** went her way and we went ours, to take a look. 

Just over one week prior to this meeting in the Board of Governors Chambers, *** came into the newspaper office, and exactly as before, my girlfriend was waiting for me to finish typing out a project and in exactly the same seats. This time *** was livid. The student editors, who chose which stories were printed, had met their 24-story quota for marks, as well as their lovers and close friends, but none of the other writers had, like herself. Without those published stories her final mark suffered. She invited me to a meeting where the writers were to confront the editors. 
I attended that meeting- by accident, as I had my first class in the room, and tired, at the end of the class with an hour free, I laid my head down on my desk to sleep when the room began filling up with writers and editors. 
*** sat on the floor. 
“I made it,” I called to her. 
“I was looking for you,” she said.
The room was unusual in that the desks were against three walls, creating a speaking well in the middle of the classroom, an unusual seating arrangement.
I spoke on behalf of the writers, earning the obvious wrath of one of the two senior editors, ***, who demanded to know why I was at the meeting, a rather odd question. 

That was just over a week prior to this meeting in the Board of Governors Chambers where *** sat beside ***, both of them dressed in white from shoulders to toes, demanding- this is not an understatement- my expulsion from the college, both citing, with three other students,  a long history of sexual harassment.
To say I was shocked is an understatement. Nothing came to mind. I could not fathom these women could tell an untruth. It was not a formulated thought of mine that they had lied. All I felt was this whole experience was surreal. 
The other three women were ***- I thought that was her first name for the longest time, like Mary Ann or Peggy Sue- but actually *** is a last name.  *** and *** were the other two. I’m sure after nearly a quarter century their last names have been all changed with marriage. 
*** was the only one of the five women who was not dressed in white. 
“Nothing of a sexual nature has happened to me,” she said. 
She told the committee she was there to support her friends and that she was a witness to many of the sexual harassment episodes. 

Interestingly, well after the hearing was done, when I showed the allegations to a retired city police inspector- he had taken up private investigating- the first thing he did after reading was tap the page with the back of his hand- where ***’s name was- and said, “She’s the ringleader.” Even then, right at the time he said it, I didn’t understand. It took a moment to fathom what he, with his long years of police investigative experience, could see in a moment. 
The allegations read out ranged from *** wrote I had rubbed my head on her legs- this was, apparently, immediately after that meeting of writers vs. editors. *** wrote I had asked her about her and her boyfriend, which, she said, were questions that were not of my business and made her feel very uncomfortable- this was part of a brief conversation about November or December, we talked sporadically as we typed. *** wrote I had leered at her leg “accidentally” exposed from the knee down-  I am not kidding here- and had also asked her out once repeatedly and she had to leave the room to end the requests- I had actually asked her what was happening in the Barn- the student bar on campus where liquor was served and musicians played- and did ask her if she wanted to go- and she, in turn,  asked her teacher boyfriend, who answered from the hallway, just outside the door, until then hidden from view, and she said they would meet me there. I ended up working late and didn’t go. *** said I had leaned on her leg while talking to her and this put her in so much fear she was afraid to leave the student newspaper office until I was well gone for some minutes. 
I was on my heels for the entirety of the hearing. It was too much to absorb. I was entirely unprepared. 
It was a bit like a police officer asking if you’d come down to the station to answer questions to get something cleared up, and instead, being escorted into a courtroom where the judge is waiting, the jury is waiting, the Crown Prosecutor is waiting, the allegations are presented, and after a 15-minute break you are told to defend yourself. 
Nothing came to mind. I rambled helplessly. 
That I had not been their fellow student for a year and a half as alleged never came to mind. I had been their classmate for one semester and three weeks, as I had graduated with my own class the year before , in April, and came back as a third-year student. 
That never came to mind. 

That I had worked late in the newspaper office with my own classmates, most of them female, ***, my editor, at least 20 times, late and alone, no problems, ***, a teacher of 14 years experience, about five times, late and alone no problems, ***, a former beauty queen, I’m sure 30 times or more, late and alone in the newspaper office, no problems, ***, once ’til 5:00 a.m., late and alone, no problems, the list goes on, ***, ***, others, if not late and alone, we worked for hours each day week in week out in our two-year college until graduation. 
That never came to mind. 
One member of the sexual harassment committee, the registrar, asked if me if anyone had ever felt uncomfortable around me before. The committee’s student member asked me if I knew it was wrong, why did I do it. I wondered aloud why the issue was happening so quickly, I just learned about the issue the previous afternoon. 
“I AM THE CHAIRMAN!” the vice-president bellowed, and I shut up about that, I thought I’d be kicked out of the room.
The women were not challenged by committee members on any item. Later I understood why. To challenge a victim on the truth of allegations is to revictimize them. That’s why I was challenged. But I was not prepared at all. I hadn’t yet even absorbed the impact of what was occurring. 
At one point *** said I had shown the allegations around the newspaper office- I had- and she wanted me “brought to issue” on that as by doing so I had disrupted their place of work and their safety. 
“We have to work there to do the work we have to do. He has disrupted it,” she said.

At home, a day or days after the sexual harassment hearing, I read the allegations for the first time. I discovered, then, for the first time, they were in the form of a petition. 
I called out to my girlfriend, “Hey! This was a petition about me!”
All these many years later it is hard to fathom the sexual harassment committee took ***’s complaint seriously, that I should be in trouble for showing a petition to students who worked in that newspaper office. I had shown about five or six female students while I sat in one spot. I really wanted to know what they thought of them. I was at a complete loss. So were they, it seemed. 
In the end I was found guilty, expelled from the college, and would only be allowed back with the permission of the college president, the two-vice-presidents, and the dean of student services.
There was no appeal permitted. 
I did write the college and ask about their appeal provisions, later, on the advice of a lawyer, who grinned broadly when the answer came back that there was no appeal. With that meant we could proceed directly to Court of Queen’s Bench. 

To make a long story short, I won in court. I returned to college just shy of one year later, in January 1996. 

A female student journalist in the new second-year class asked me for an interview about what I’d gone through. She suggested we go into anther room for the interview. We walked into the very room where, almost exactly one year before, that writers vs. editors meeting had taken place. She likely would have known nothing about it. She would have been a first-year student then. 
The room looked exactly the same. The desks were in the exactly the same place, against three walls of the classroom, creating a speaking well in the middle of the room. 
It felt surreal. As she asked questions I ignored her, walking from desk to desk, putting my hands on the desks, incredulous. It was as if I walked into a time tunnel, suddenly transported back one year before the sexual harassment hearing, before the court process. It was as if I had been transported back in time to the last place where things made sense. 
I didn’t sue for money. I just wanted the decision of the college overturned so I could continue my education. 
I returned to the college and lasted one semester. Those looks of disdain I had from the communications staffer and that receptionist were rife in the college They were everywhere. I was untrusted and the talk of the college. I felt so uncomfortable I let go of my plans for two additional diplomas. 
I’ll leave it there.
","I was a student in a community college. 
","Classmates. 
",Small Liberal Arts College,"Lethbridge Community College. It's name has since changed to Lethbridge College. It was a community college for vocations and trades, not really a Liberal Arts College, but that's the closest description, above. ",Print Journalism ,,As above. I should add one of the points I won the case on was that the college violated the Individual Rights Protection Act. After I won my case the college revised their sexual harassment policy. All mention of the Individual Rights Protection Act was removed from the new policy. ,"None. They were treated quite well, with every sympathy. After I was expelled one was quoted in the student newspaper, saying, “It will never end. I sacrificed a big part of myself.” So they played victim to the end of their time in college. And beyond, but I'm getting word count warnings, so I can't add much. Interestingly, our photography instructor dropped by, weeks after the hearing, months before the court date, and informed me *** had, the previous semester, gathered a number of female students together to give him negative teaching evaluations. So her assembling female students together to jeopardize my future at the college wasn't the first time she had done such a thing. It was the second time. ",No idea. ,"Not entirely sure. I am very untrusting now, even all this time later, extraordinarily so, even of friends. I am still rather stubborn. I get very upset with obvious injustice. That may be a good outcome. On the downside I do have a lot of 'Why bother' moments. I first felt that after the hearing, deeply, for weeks. It was all so surreal that at times just getting off a chair and crossing a room seemed absurd. Why would anyone walk across a room? Why would you do anything? Why would you plan for anything? It was as if suddenly discovering birds never flew, they walked on sidewalks while carrying luggage, and people parked cars on their sides, trees never had leaves, the sky had always been green and grass purple, and people ate on rooftops burning money to keep their plates warm, and everyone acted as if that was normal, and only to me it was all making no sense. That is the best way to describe how surreal it was. That feeling hasn't completely left, as it still comes back from time to time and it's been almost 25 years. That's a considerable downside. It's energy-sapping. I should add my girlfriend at the time ended up in the hospital over this. It seemed information overload. She was in hospital a few days. The nurse had given her a glass of orange juice and my girlfriend, after the nurse left, wanted it watered down. It was too thick, she said. I kept watering it down and she kept tasting it, asking me to water it down. In the end it looked like water. She said it still tasted like syrup. That broke me. I nearly gave up fighting. That was a big 'why bother' moment. It was too much. Entirely too much. I'm not sure how I recovered from that moment to continue to fight. I nearly gave the whole thing up then. ","I graduated in print journalism. I still write. I did write a book about this issue back then. A well-placed college staffer told me I would not win in court, that I was trying to push over an apple cart. So that's what I called the book, Pushing Over the Apple Cart. I split the book in three volumes and never did publish Book III. Book 1 is free. Kobo sells it as an ebook. This isn't a plug for the book, it's just more or less answering the question, above. I graduated in writing and I write. ",,Female

12/5/2017 23:54:56,"As a PhD student, I found myself mired in icky ambiguously sexual circumstances with 2 different professors. The least awful was a professor who held his final seminar session in a bar over pitchers of beer & then invited me to for a bite to eat afterward. I hoped we were going to talk about my project &  thought surely he meant we'd grab a burger or some quick Thai food. But then he walked me into an expensive white table cloth restaurant and proceeded to order appetizers and wine and all these things he surely knew I could not afford. So reluctantly and awkwardly I let him pay, which made me feel crazy. After, he casually said let's go to my place to finish talking about your paper & I really really really wanted to go home but didn't know how to say that and felt so strange about having been treated to such an expensive meal. It sounds insane but I couldn't figure out how to get out of this night with him. It was all so confusing b/c in class he talked all the time about his kids and wife (""my wife"" and never by name. She was a fairly visible feminist & in hind sight, I see that he leveraged her feminism all the time to position himself as a feminist. UGH.) Anyway, I felt terribly embarrassed to be taking this as a date when he had made himself out to be such a family man & felt confused about how to extract myself, especially because I was still hoping for help in publishing the essay I had written for his seminar and that I cared so passionately about. That was icky but it was only 1 seminar and 1 grade at stake. More shattering was the next year when I was promoted from graduate teaching assistant to the prized fellowship everyone wanted - assistant editor to a very prestigious journal. The editor, my boss and a leading feminist, was both gate-keeper in my field and now boss of my graduate fellowship. She held in hand, then, both my immediate daily survival and the keys to my future, a future I had leveraged with considerable student loans. Although my fellowship contract obligated me to provide 20 hours a week of editing work, my boss expanded the duties to include coordinating dry cleaning, car repairs, credit card disputes, out-out-town fee-based speaking engagements and travel plans, etc. I wasn't allowed to go home for winter break b/c it was time to copy edit the galleys. This makes no sense b/c the journal was published in Baltimore by Johns Hopkins & we were editing on the west coast. So what did it matter where I finished the galleys? My boss never looked at the articles after the initial content editing was done anyway so it's not like we needed to collaborate. What I'm trying to explain is how I felt a little imprisoned, almost indentured. Sexual harassment was the cherry on top of this toxic covenant. I felt uncomfortable all the time & started wearing baggy clothing, which my boss hated. One time in front of my peers, she mocked the overalls I was wearing, exclaiming, ""I can fit a fist in your pants"" and then proceeded to shove not 1 but 2 fists into my crouch, right there in front of everyone. Another time at a conference, after I had just presented my paper and people were swarming to congratulate and ask me questions, she interrupted everything to spank me, right there in front of my peers and prospective future employers. I was mortified and I swear my brain stayed frozen for many days after that incident. I was so stuck and had sacrificed everything for this opportunity to study so I thought I had to accept the behavior. I thought I was managing but was so surprised each morning to discover that my pillow was wet. I lived in a crappy apartment so naturally I looked for a ceiling leak that might be the source of the wet pillow. Honestly, I really thought it was caused by an environmental leak until I finally realized my pillow was soggy from the salt tears I had been weeping in my sleep. I guess my conscious hours were so completely indentured that the only time I could cry was during sleep. I was trapped in a viciously competitive environment and so we students carefully guarded our secrets from each other. (Tragically, then, we didn't support each other or warn one other of possible hazards.) For this reason, I suspect but can not confirm that at least 2 other women in my program also may have experienced sexual coercion and harassment. One of them may have been in an even more precarious position than me b/c she was on a student visa and needed this professor's support to maintain her visa status.  
I completed my degree because I’m not a “quitter.” But I never asked for a letter of recommendation and I never once checked to see what jobs might be available in my field. All I could do was flee the entire sphere of influence. I paid off my student loans by working in a field unrelated to my training and in fact one for which a college degree is entirely unnecessary. I maintain that the abuse changed the course of my life, a fact about which I am still bitter.
I’m telling you this now for several reasons.
1. I’m tired of holding it in my body and am ready to release this bitterness.
2. I believe that young students are vulnerable and should be entitled to a safe place in which to complete their educations.
3. College & graduate students are impressionable; the reality is that they are being cultivated as future workers & bosses in every sector of our economy. In this way, sexual misconduct on our campuses contributes to and perpetuates an insidious culture of harassment which spreads throughout the entire economy. For this reason, campus abuse has the potential to harm all workers, not just college students and graduates. 
4. Although I am grateful for my education and believe that you can never foreclose on the knowledge and thinking skills I carry in my head, technically I don’t use my education because I felt too traumatized to pursue the career I studied. 
5. My education was partially funded with public dollars which subsidized my graduate fellowship and student loans. One could argue this public investment was wasted because I never attempted to work in the field for which I trained. If you buy my statement that I was deterred by systematic abuse, that is an egregious betrayal of the public trust & resources.

12/6/2017 3:02:01,"As a job candidate on a campus visit, male members of the department staff entered my hotel room against my explicitly expressed wishes. On two different occasions (is this a thing?) (It was early 2000s, so I'm hoping things have changed...)

In the first campus visit, my unwelcome guest followed me to the room after I picked up the key at the hotel reception desk. He had been helping me by pulling my (very small) wheelie-bag. Once I had my key, I told him 'thanks so much, I'll take it from here.' He responded by not handing the bag over, but proceeding down the hall toward the room, the number of which he evidently knew. At the door of the room, I thanked him again and expressed my gratitude for his having met me at the airport etc. and told him I was looking forward to continuing our discussion of local colonial history over dinner. I reached for my bag which he relinquished. I then pulled it over towards me, turned, and opened the door. He then held the door open for me as I pulled the bag in to the room. I stopped, turned back, and said, 'thanks again' only to have him push past me into the hotel room. I had told him - three times - that I didn't want him in my hotel room, despite whatever pedagogical benefit he thought his presence my have for me. In the room, he stood by the bed and explained the history of the view out the window. I interjected to tell him I was tired after my flight and needed to rest/freshen up before meeting the person driving me to the dinner.  I walked back and stood at the room door, holding it open.  He left.

I didn't think this was 'sexual harassment' so much as just plain rude. So I wrote this first incident off as 'just weird', figuring they'd sent someone with poor social skills who thought it would be more important for me to understand local economy history as written in the landscape than feel safe and have my boundaries respected. Not someone I necessarily wanted to have as a colleague, but, ok, whatever.... At least they let me know this guy likely wouldn't listen to me on any other matter either....

On the second visit - same thing, campus visit for a TT position - this happened after the obligatory second night's more informal dinner with grad students and faculty. So I was already exhausted from a 22 hour long-haul flight, the research presentation, interview, teaching demonstration, first breakfast meeting, meeting with the Dean, meeting with grad students, and a trip to a local attraction, we had this last dinner. And, after dinner, Prof A suggested we go on to a pub that was on the walking route back to my hotel. Since I was in one of those disciplines where there's a culture of pub-going and it's very important, in terms of perceived 'fit', for a female candidate to show she has a sense of humour and can hold a drink, I knew this was still the 'fit' part of the interview. 

After what I thought was two rounds of drinks, it was arranged that Prof A would walk me back from the pub to the hotel - short distance, but easy to get lost and 'not safe' for a woman alone.  I had a breakfast meeting the next morning, then that was it - my breakfast interviewer, Prof B, would take me directly to the airport afterwards. 

Prof A and I had been discussing teaching and pedagogy in our research area and how to integrate research into undergrad teaching over our post-dinner drink. As we walked up to the front of my hotel, I suggested I could pass on some course outlines I'd put together but not circulated during my interview. These covered areas of pedagogical strategy we'd discussed in the pub and he could add them to the file the selection panel would review. Total mistake.

The course outlines were in the 'interview folder' I'd left in my hotel room earlier that even. So we walked Into the hotel lobby and I motioned to the chairs in the reception area and told him 'please wait here, I'll only be a minute.'   He ignored that and followed me on to the elevator. His lack of response to my directions showed me he was clearly more inebriated than I had initially thought.  Despite my telling him to wait at the elevator, he followed me to the room door. I couldn't believe this was actually happening (again), but I didn't want to be rude (or violent.)  Despite my telling him, even more firmly to 'wait at the door' and pulling it so it would close behind me -  in his face - he pushed the door open, came into the room, and then stretched out on the bed....  So I gave him the course outlines by tossing them on top of his chest. Then I told him 'you need to go home NOW', relieved that the room layout meant I could easily sprint for it and lock myself in the bathroom. Thanks be, he finally got the message and left. 

By the time I got to breakfast with Prof B, I was furious that I'd found myself in that position while ON A CAMPUS VISIT JOB INTERVIEW. TWICE.",Job applicant on a campus interview on both occasions,Member of the interviewing department's faculty and selection committee,"More Than One Institution (feel free to elaborate in ""Comments"")","University of Minnesota, Duluth/University of Kentucky, Lexiington",Geography,,"I didn't report the first incident, because it seemed to be simply a very 'tone-deaf' senior male academic being insensitive. 

I reported the second incident in somewhat indirect terms to Prof B.  I explained to him that I had been somewhat disconcerted by the end of the previous evening because Prof A had become pretty inebriated and had followed me into the hotel and up to my room. I explained I had felt compelled to be rather rude to him to get him to leave my room. I told Prof B that Prof A's actions had made me very uncomfortable. I asked if Prof A had issues around boundaries with younger/junior female colleagues and Prof B gave me an answer in the affirmative. Prof B discouraged me from taking the job, suggesting my career would be better off if I stayed on the fixed-term contract post-doc I held at the time. Prof B did not suggest any institutional reporting or wider discussion...  I couldn't figure out if this advice was meant for my own well-being or because Prof B favoured another candidate.

I noted that as a very weak institutional response, which gave me no confidence in departmental culture. I was offered the job. And decided that I wouldn't take it  because I couldn't face dealing with Prof A (or Prof B) and couldn't imagine that this awkward encounter or any further/future issues along the same lines wouldn't be interpreted as reflecting badly on me in that particular department and in the wider discipline. 

I eventually discussed the reasons behind my decision to decline a very good TT job with a male mentor in my discipline. He confirmed that Prof A had a history of striking up 'inappropriate' relationships with grad students and junior faculty members. Subsequent discussions with Prof A's former graduate students (male) confirmed this was the case.  One colleague explained to me that it was more or less just part of a female colleague's necessary professional skills to be able to navigate that dynamic, because we were all adults. 

","Nil, as far as I am aware.","Ironically, I was successful in both interviews. But I came away so uncomfortable with my glimpse of 'departmental culture' in both places that I declined two TT jobs.","The first incident shook me a little. The second really undermined my self-confidence and I associated it with a subsequent episode of mild depression, treated with counselling. I found it very difficult to be productive and to be enthused about publishing the in field of my PhD - my work overlapped significantly with Prof A's and that of several of his students and proteges. I'd been really excited about working with him as a mentor and collaborator in terms of developing my future projects and publications.  I came away feeling rootless and unenthused about my academic career. Here, I'd put all my efforts into what had been an effective pitch for at TT job in what was a high-profile research cluster internationally. And what mattered to the high-flying research powerhouse professor in my field seemed to be my 'pleasing personality' and possible availability for an extramarital liaison...., not my research or possible trajectory etc. So, narcissistic wound and much anxiety created... And I associated what happened with not being 'on top of my game' after long plane flights and the cross-cultural differences in communication involved in interviewing in the USA (not being American myself)...which was both minute self-blame and a huge extrapolation. I decided I needed coaching on being less 'pleasing' and more forceful in interview contexts etc.","I started collaborating with people outside my discipline and publishing in other areas, so became very interdisciplinary and very cynical about the culture of recognition in my PhD discipline. Career-wise I remained in my post-doc and then eventually converted that into a contract Research Fellowship.  I never applied for another job in the USA. I eventually took up a continuing appointment in a third country.  This means I no longer live on the same continent as a my parents and most of my immediate family. I have a career, but it's a different one, with a different trajectory and location.","Once is happenstance, twice is coincidence... three times is way more than a bad habit - it's a culture of harassment. I'd like to know if a) anyone else has had this experience of being harassed/treated inappropriately as a campus visit candidate (I usually find I'm never alone in this stuff) and b) if any departments have actually briefed faculty involved in the interview process that the job candidates hotel rooms are 'out of bounds' and private space, even if they are paid for by the host institution.

12/6/2017 5:13:21,"As a young assistant professor at an art school I noticed an older adjunct faculty member who would lurk in the halls or appear out of nowhere and stare. Other colleagues agreed he was ""creepy."" Fast forward 10 years. I was now department chair and it came to my attention that this same guy, who taught poetry writing, was making female undergraduates pretty uncomfortable. Rather than teaching everyone together in a classroom, he held tutorials in his tiny office with the door closed so that he could work with each individual student on her writing. One student came forward when she received an envelope of poems at her home address (which she had not shared with him -- he had gotten the registrar to tell him where she lived). Although he would deny it, the poems were highly suggestive and personal, mentioning, for example, a tattoo on her leg and the street she lived on. He also called her on her cell phone and asked her questions about her boyfriend. He would have students bring some of their art to class so he could help them translate their inspiration into words; in her case he honed in on a photograph in which she appeared in the background, in the shadows, partly nude. (This was in that tiny office with the door closed.) The student filed a complaint, and I had her taken out of the class and asked another colleague to work with her through the rest of the semester so that she could get credit for the course. This was just the first incident. This student filed a complaint which was adjudicated through a complex system that included both the in-house sexual harassment procedure and the state-wide faculty union grievance process. His defense was that he was working very hard with each student to draw out their creative energy based on what he saw in their work, and of course, they explored all kinds of subjects in their work. The fact that they were 20 years old and he was somewhere in his 70s, supposedly mature enough to know where to draw the line, did not seem to register. He had several advocates in the department, all male and quite senior to me, who argued that his writing poems for the students was a matter of free speech, and that stopping it would cast a shadow over the principles of artistic freedom at the school. The poet was able to keep his job with a stern warning, an order not to have students in his office alone, and a remedial sexual harassment training program -- something required by state law that had not really been enforced for adjunct faculty, putting the university in a position of potential liability. He came to my office in the fall and told me he was very sorry, he now understood, and I would never have any trouble with him again. I told him I hoped he meant it. But of course he kept up the same behavior, choosing new students for his obsession each term. After the students saw that he had not been fired, they were very reluctant to bring new complaints against him, and feeling very upset that I had not been able to get justice for the first student, I did not feel I could push them to complain, as I could make no promises. I could only take the incident to the civil rights officer, but without a formal complaint we could go no further. Every time I went to him and told him I knew what he was up to, he wanted to know who complained, and whined about how he had a constitutional right to face his accuser. He denied and denied, and begged me not to take away the only meaningful thing left in his life. After a couple of these incidents he seems to have understood he couldn't do this with students in his class, but decided it would be ok to stalk random students he saw in the halls. Two years after my term was up, he turned his attention to a graduate student, followed her to the cafeteria, invited himself to have lunch with her, offered to help her with recommendations, etc. She didn't like it but she felt she had to be polite to a professor. Then he wrote a little play and e-mailed it to her. There was immediately a second e-mail saying ""maybe you shouldn't open that other e-mail but just delete it."" Naturally she opened it. It was very explicit. She brought it to public safety, who called HR, and at last he was escorted out of the building and banned from campus.

Although it has been over 10 years, my pulse increases every time I remember it and writing this is stressful in itself. I continue to second-guess my younger self and wonder if I could have done better by the students.

I chose to arrange my teaching situation so that I would not have to deal with this person's supporters any longer, and I have shied away from leadership roles in the college unless the project and goals were short-term and clearly defined -- for example, working on the promotions and tenure committees. This is also partly because the longer I am in the academy the more I remember one of my mother's favorite metaphors: it's like shoveling shit against the tide. I think I can do more as a scholar and teacher, working directly with students rather than trying to fix a flawed system. And I am certainly happier and healthier that way.

The faculty member in question and his friends have already made enough of this public with their ridiculous indignation that I am not concerned about violating confidentiality.

At a hotel stay during a field trip with students he insisted on hosting a party in his hotel room in his bathrobe. He apparently groped a student's breast in a drunken state. 

During a critique session with a female student (who it turns out had been traumatized at an early age), he started to discuss with her his stimulation preferences and how many fingers were appropriate for vaginal stimulation.

We were in several classes together and through hints he managed to convince the professor I wanted to work with that we had had or were having a turbulent sexual relationship. We were not. 2) As an early assistant professor at a small conference, a peer at another institution--someone great, fun to talk to, very smart about language, and (of course?!) professedly unhappy in his home life--kept lightly touching me and finally less than lightly. I froze; he asked ""so, you don't like hugs?"" This person was married with several children and he knew I was going through a painful, confusing divorce.

The program was set in a way that through ongoing mentorship, research and creative production is developed. The mentor is given a healthy production budget to create work while accompanying the student/younger artist through the process of developing and creating their work. There are about 12 students in any given year and 4 mentors, leaving each mentor with 3 younger artists to follow and meet regularly with in the studio or as they feel fit.

This man was invited to mentor young artists + film makers and was paired by the institution to work with me. To say the meetings were uncomfortable and inappropriate is an understatement.  We met initially at the studio and since this generated in me feelings of discomfort at later dates we met in an office at the institution as to be in a more public setting.

First: a different male professor regularly showed video of violence against women, sometimes sexual violence, in a seminar and would dock students’ grades if they left the room for the duration of the video. Second: a male professor regularly initiated sexual relationships with female graduate students on false pretenses, then intimidated them into staying away from campus.

I did not attempt suicide but I frequently wanted to. It took many years to get back on even emotional footing and unlearn the trauma responses I picked up. ","I thank God every day that I left academia. I miss teaching and research like the dickens, but nothing is worth what you have to put up with in academia. I moved into tech.

12/6/2017 8:46:00,"Final year at SMCC a few of us went out to watch one of our professors play piano at a local restaurant. His drummer came over to talk with us during a break and we discussed my guitar lessons and enjoyment of singing. 
Evening ended with my receiving a ride home from the drummer because it was late and I had a drink that was making me feel tipsy. Guy was a complete gentleman and made sure I got in. Also received an invite to check out this folk group this drummer liked. I agreed thinking it would be fun. 

We went the next evening to the show. I went with the intent of enjoying the show with a new friend. He was married and I had no interest in him other than a friend. That evening he offered to drop off a cd of a band he managed to see if it may be of interest to me to join. We made a plan to meet at a local coffee shop that following weekend. Before we met he emailed me an urged he needed to come by later than planned and would meet me at my place. I wouldn't normally let someone I hardly know stop by my place but where he was friends with my professor and was a professor himself I trusted him. Big mistake. Within 15 minutes of him entering my place he made a move. I told him I wasn't interested as he was a married man and I don't get involved with men in relationships. He apologized and we went back to talking. Then out of the blue he is pushing me down on the couch and forcing me to have sex threatening me the whole time.

Men live under fear of such individuals and situations since accusations are rarely believed, or the man is disregarded/laughed at if they bring accusations.

12/6/2017 9:46:57,"I was one of four young, female research assistants working for a senior tenured professor at Simon Fraser University, who was also the primary supervisor for my Master's degree. I had moved across the country from Nova Scotia specifically to work with him, because he was internationally recognized for his research on substance use. Prior to moving I spoke with two former students of his, who cautioned me against working with him because he was known to have a temper and didn't work well with women. 

I was 21 and alone in a new city. Initially he was very warm and we enjoyed a great rapport. He brought me on to exciting projects and we co-authored several papers together. He learned that I lived near his home and began suggesting that we have work meetings there, over a glass of wine. I was uncomfortable with these meetings, but felt obligated to go so I wouldn't miss out on research opportunities. The meetings frequently went from the professional to the personal, where he would share intimate details of his life with me: his failed marriage, the child he had co-parented, etc. I felt sorry for him and figured he was just another lonely, work-obsessed academic. 

I began to sense underlying tension and stress at our research center a few months in. I learned through the other RA's that my supervisor was known for being verbally abusive and was prone to screaming at them in person, sending late-night ranting emails, and accusing them of ""sabotaging"" his career. During my time at the center, two of his longest-serving RA's quit, and one of them shared her concerns with the Dean of the Faculty. She was offered a job with the Dean's office, and the university did not take any disciplinary action (that I'm aware of) or check on the well-being of the other Research Assistants under his employment. His other Master's student, a man, quit within 3 months of working with him. 

In my second year, my supervisor invited me to join him on an all-expenses-paid trip to Brazil to work on a collaborative research project. Over the 10-day trip we worked together all day, every day and stayed at the same hotel. He was in great spirits, and I felt like the ""chosen"" student. When I was leaving to return to Canada, he reached across the taxi and held my hand. I did nothing and tried to interpret it as a fatherly gesture. As I was leaving I mentioned I was excited to travel back to Nova Scotia in a few weeks to spend Christmas with my boyfriend.  

Things deteriorated as soon as I returned to Canada. I found a series of long, ranting emails that the other RA's had warned me about. He claimed I had made an error in a literature review that had humiliated him in front of our international collaborators, and accused me of being incompetent and trying to ruin his career. After a string of abusive emails, he cut off virtually all communication with me. I was in the middle of writing up my thesis and he made it clear that he would not be available to support my work. I was completely isolated. 

As Christmas came closer, he told me that I was too far behind to take holidays and that he didn't want me to leave. I did not share details of my travel plans with him, and left. He went found a printout of my travel itinerary at the office and send me a series of belligerent emails where he insisted that I needed to return immediately, claiming that he had left (long-awaited) feedback on my thesis at the office. I phoned my program chair in tears, telling her I needed to find another supervisor. She encouraged me to stay because my defense had already been scheduled and it would be better than starting over. 

I successfully defended my thesis, with a friend in the room for support. I could have pushed for a publication afterwards, but I didn't want to have any further contact with him. He made me feel like a failure. 

My friend (a man) started his PhD with my former supervisor a few months later, and quit shortly after experiencing a screaming tirade where he was insulted and threatened with physical violence (his exact words: ""I will kill you"".). In the years since, I've learned that his abuse was systemic and widely known within the research community (I always get a raised eyebrow from other academics when I mention his name). 

I found myself in a situation where I was totally powerless, had no institutional support and was subjected to verbal abuse and inappropriate romantic overtures from someone I trusted and admired. I know there are people who have experienced far worse, but I've found ways to minimize what happened to me for too long.

I was twenty-two. A tall, not-quite-middle-aged, loud, white male, wearing, I kid-you-not, a tweed jacket with elbow patches and carrying a leather shoulder bag, walked up to my poster. He stared at it for less than a minute, stepped into my personal space, towering over me, and made a comment about my NAME. Not the content of the intellectual material on the poster. My NAME. Then he turned and walked away. I was stunned. 

(2) I attended an undergraduate-organized geography conference at another school during my last semester of college. At the ""after party"" at the hotel bar the last night of the conference, the guest speaker's husband, also an academic, sat next to me. ""Can I buy your drink? I make a lot of money, a LOT of money, so it's no big deal,"" he said to me. I didn't enjoy drinking then, and I do not drink now, but I thought it rude to refuse his offer. He asked me question after question for what felt like hours. About my work, about my grades, about where I wanted to attend graduate school. I didn't have the opportunity to socialize with anyone else at the table, he was so commanding of my attention. I was uncomfortable. He was insistent that I apply to his school to work with him, even though my research interests were in no way similar to his ""area of expertise."" Finally, I excused myself and went to bed. 

(3) I met a friend's (we graduated from the same undergraduate program and went on to graduate school at different institutions) academic advisor my first semester of graduate school (Fall 2013) when they were attending a conference in a nearby town. My friend slept on my couch so he didn't have to pay for a hotel. His advisor picked him up from my apartment the next day. I gave them both a brief tour of campus. As I stood on the front step of my apartment, my friend's advisor asked if I really wanted to leave the house ""like that."" I was wearing athletic pants. It was early on a Saturday morning. I ignored his comment. 

The next year I met up with my friend and his advisor for lunch during the AAG Annual Meeting (Spring 2015). He commented about my wedding ring, a thin, plain, simple band. ""I assume you wear that because you're a poor graduate student,"" he said. I ignored his comment. Not that it matters, but I wore that ring because I am an athlete.

Three years later, I heard a story from another graduate student in my friend's department, that my friend's advisor had made ""joking"" comments about my friendship with his advisee during a class where he had included a paper I had published in the course syllabus. ""Don't worry,"" he said to my friend's girlfriend, who was taking the class at the time, ""There's nothing going on between them. You don't have any competition with her. She's married.""

12/6/2017 12:55:32,"In 1999, I was a master's student in criminology at the university of Toronto in Canada. The director of the centre,  Clifford Shearing, was one of my profs. He was grooming me for the PHD program and acting as a mentor of sorts and invited me to meet some of his PHD students at a bar after school. He told me that he had to pick up some clothes at the dry cleaners first and then go home to change and drop them off- then we would go to the bar. He asked me to come with him in his car. I was very hesitant to do this. I knew that he had a history of dating his PHD students. I knew from a very good friend that he had left his wife of 30 years for one of his PHD students. 
Reluctantly I went in his car- wanting to meet the PHD students as my goal. When I entered into his house he gave me a tour and showed me every room including his bedroom. I felt very uncomfortable and immediately went downstairs and stood at the front door telling him i would wait there for him. 
Seconds later he came down the stairs with his jeans undone and his penis hanging out. He sat on the love seat in the living room and patted the seat beside him as an invitation to come sit beside him and do as he wished. I was stunned. I didn't say a word and sat in the rocking chair across from him. He took one look at me and said, ""You can go now."" I replied, ""so, we're not going to meet your students?""  He answered, ""you can meet them another time."" 
I left immediately and ran down the street crying. Called my husband from a pay phone and felt sick. 
The next day, I told another student what happened and asked her who i should tell (which profs). She told me to keep my mouth shut and just finish my MA and get out. She said he would make my life hell- he has done it to other students before and no other prof would support me. I was devastated. My dream was to do my PHD.

Then, I walked over the library to check my email before class and noticed that I had a new friend request on a messenger program from him. I didn't know what to do, so I accepted the request and when I got home later that night, he started typing to me about what classes I was taking this semester and what I was up to, etc. General conversation. This went on for a few weeks and the conversations got more personal and he started to push questions that were sexual, and invited me for lunch sometime and to his apartment for a research get together. I cut the conversation off after it started to become inappropriate but he pursued me. He continued to message me, and at some point during that term, left a ""gift"" for me in his mailbox which was a CD of love songs which was the creepiest thing I have ever encountered. He then pushed meeting at his apartment, so I obliged and drove out to his place knowing that I didn't feel comfortable with this but I was also scared of him. He assured me that other students would be there, so I walked up the stairs to his apartment, and when I opened the door I say 5-6 other women present, too. So, I felt better. The students were drinking wine and talking and he was in the kitchen making pizza and I think brownies. He then proceeded to join the conversation and everything seemed OK. He put on a movie that we all watched together and served brownies and pizza. Then, the girl who was sitting next to me got up to use the bathroom, and when she came back, she sat down on a recliner chair. I then got up to use the bathroom, and when I came back to sit on the couch (movie was still playing) he was sitting in the spot next to me. I sat down and he placed his hand down, so I sat on his hand and immediately froze. Then a few minutes later, I excused myself and left. He walked me to my car, opened the door for me and leaned in for a hug and I jumped into my car and sped off. I never answered his messages again and worked in a different lab. Then, a few years later he came to my poster at an academic conference and gave me his hotel information and invited me to his hotel for a drink. I declined and left the conference. Fast forward, I am an assistant professor in my hometown in the same department that he is in. It's awkward, and the stories are endless.

They are so close that she has a different honours thesis supervisor because of their current close relationship. Moreover, a string of negative comments about me personally appeared on a professor rating site around the first week of classes that were in reference to my personality and my weight. They also made reference to my ""LTA-limited term"" faculty status, which students wouldn't know that I have. My RA noticed it when she was looking up a publication I wrote for a citation and was shocked by how personally insulting the string of comments were. The website actually took them down because they were so insulting. I can't put my finger on it, but I really do think that this professor is behind a lot of drama that happens with faculty and students here. I reported this to my department head because the prof's student keeps coming by every one of my office hours to interrogate me about questions not even related to the course, but they refer to him as a light weight and see him as a joke.

I was very keen to work with him and learn from him.  So I initially approached him. We rode the metro home together from the library and he was very solicitous and friendly, so eventually I confided in him that I was having suicidal thoughts. My mother had recently died, and I was then heading into a severe depressive disorder, a complete breakdown.    He was about 15 or 20 years older than I was, and he presented himself as a concerned person, a kind of rabbi or therapist.  He encouraged me to consider taking medication.  I looked up to him both as an older man who himself had struggled with sorrow and as an intellectual mentor.   I now realize that he was grooming me.  We were ""friends"" for about nine months before he made a pass at me during a conference at the University of Chicago. He did not come to dinner one night because, he said, he was ill.  I went to check on him at his hotel room,  as I would have done for any friend.   When he first came on to me, my stomach lurched and I felt as though I would throw up.

He led me to believe that I was different than the ones who came before and that we had a future.  Then he went back to his wife and cut things off.

12/6/2017 14:21:15,"I entered into what I thought was a consensual relationship with a same-aged colleague during my postdoc. Our relationship lasted two years. We were in different labs but with overlapping research, which became more similar while we were together (and while we discussed our ideas). He was gaslighting me the whole time. While we were still sleeping together, he began writing a paper that specifically and viciously, by name, targeted my ideas. It was published in a journal on whose editorial board he (and his PhD advisor) were members. He thanked me in the acknowledgements (misspelling my name). I did not know until shortly before his paper came out, and would not have shared any of my ideas, unpublished manuscripts or grants, if I had known. I would never have consented to sex (or even friendship) if I had known about his paper. Although I thought our sex was consensual, he knew I couldn’t consent on the (one as far as I know) occasion that occurred after he started writing his paper. While that is not rape exactly, I still feel sexually violated.

I moved apartments after we broke up for other reasons (he had submitted his paper at that point, but I did not know). He tried to find out where I lived and showed up at a social event for a mutual friend even though I had told him I was not comfortable being in the same room. He also texted me for about a year wanting to meet in person (during which, still unknown to me, his paper was in review and then in press).

I had to see him in person at a conference (this year, after his paper was published) and he didn’t try to approach, but I had also told two male friends what he had done, and they flanked me the entire time. Meanwhile, he still has documents that I shared on work I haven’t published. ",Postdoc,"Started as postdoc, now he is a “rising star” assistant professor.

Furthermore, because I had to bury work I had already done, I have published more slowly and am still a postdoc while he is now on the TT.

I am also afraid when I see his PhD advisor (who is at a different university in my city, so I see him at talks related to our research sometimes).

The experiences was more like a small cult operating on campus. There was this one guy who used to be a Masters Student at the UofA back in the 1980's, but it did not work out so he  runs a mailing/Copy store on campus. He is still very much connected to Academia because it was my friend who is PhD' student at the time that introduced me to him. At first he appeared to be all father figure and loving, and at the time I was searching for a fatherly influence in my life because mine had died, I was searching for God and trying to find my way into this world. I was lost. So he took me under his wing, until a year later he started performing sex acts on me in the name of religion. When I would fight back and say stop, he would fight me back and tell me all sorts of things that were wrong with me, and thats when the brainwashing happened. He had me convinced that I was sick and needed his sexual touching to ""heal"" me, and everyone who operated in that inner circle took his side and demonized me. So I followed the crowed because I was being bullied, and they had me convinced I was spiritually damaged. There were times when I was in the back of his store- naked. Him molesting me. I wanted to scream and run out, but all I could think about was the shame and humiliation and dishonour this would bring to my family, and all the pain it would cause my siblings.There were so many people waiting in the store, and I could not do anything.

We were all lecturers at a private, quite exclusive university. I was one of 2 women working with 8 men. One man had a very ""one of the lads"" way of interacting with the other men.  With myself and the other woman, he chose not to interact at all. We were invisible (which, because of his attitude and aggressive nature, was fine by us.) He would bicycle into work each day, and strip down to only his underpants, wipe his armpits and chest with a towel, and change into his work clothes for the day in his cubical area. Remember, this is an open-concept office, the cubical was just 2 low moveable walls, no door. We were all witness to his morning habits. I asked him twice to please change in the side-office, the one we used for consultations with students during work hours. He refused, stating that we were all adults, and in any case, I was married and familiar with the male human body. I had to resort to telling the head of our group, who in turn asked my co-worker to stop it. His response? He confronted me, and said I was upsetting the harmony in the office.

During the process of removing him from my committee, which required a meeting with every-freaking-body, he then began to spread rumors that I was sleeping with the person I asked to take over my committee and that's why I wanted to change my committee.

12/6/2017 19:09:35,"(I'll give you one of a long list of occurrences I have experienced.) Over the course of a few years, I endured a string of harassing incidents from a more senior colleague, from being labelled ""the feminist"" to being called a ""psycho feminazi wench"" (in an email, no less). He tried to ""give me a birthday kiss"" in the photocopy room, in front of another male colleague. He hit on me at a college function in front of a group of male students and at another function in front of colleagues. After the incident in front of male students, I a wrote a complaint. It was handled internally.   
Following my complaint, he proceeded to slander me to my colleagues and any staff member who would listen. When a new President took office, he managed to get his ear and actively tried to tank my tenure bid. My tenure was delayed a year and almost derailed. I had received 4 letters of support for tenure from external evaluators. I had published a book and several articles. I had excellent (empirically validated) student evaluations, and had been a non-tenured President of my national scholarly society. After the year delay, the Dean told me he was going to recommend I not receive tenure. I told him I had a labour lawyer. And was not averse to putting their faces on the front page of the local paper. ","I was a contract instructor/tenure track. 
","He was tenure-track/tenured.

","I have spent the last 5 years fighting for my tenure, trying to write, trying to stay invested in my teaching, trying to research. I have been bullied about my field of study (""too narrow,"" ""too focused on women,"" ""not theological enough,"" ""too feminist"") to the point where I live with a type of PTSD about my work. I have been disparaged among the staff of the College and some of this has gotten to students. All because I rejected the advances of a sexist, misogynist colleague. ","I float in and out of depression and anxiety, for which I am medicated, and I have chronic stress headaches. I am in therapy and trying to sort through it all. 
","I'm back in the classroom after a full year sabbatical following tenure (I guess they didn't want to fight a legal battle they knew they would lose). I spent a good bit of my time reflecting on the strength required to stay in the academy and the shame associated with taking all those years of shit. I came a bit late to my career and I need the financial stability my academic life affords me, so leaving at this point feels precarious. But if I could find something I'd love as much, with the kind of stability my current position offers me, I'd leave. The book I write as I leave academic life will be an account of all the shit women face not only in the academy but more specifically in my discipline. This scenario is one of many different incidents of harassment (sexual and otherwise) I've faced as a scholar. I have some amazing colleagues (male and female) and some total dough heads.

12/6/2017 19:10:12,"I was a visiting PhD fellow at the CUNY Graduate Centre in NYC in 2007 taking a number of courses with their preeminent elderly white male professor of Marxist Geography. As a mature student, an out lesbian of colour and a longstanding political activist I largely kept my distance from the social life of bars that was the cultural life of the largely white male marxists in the department. After two months of interesting course work I decided to attend a departmental event, reception and after-social at the pub. My professor suggested we sit at the bar away from the departmental crowd to have a chance to talk. Amidst an interesting political and intellectual exchange, a few drinks and laughs I turned to  get something from my bag - when I turned back to the table he was suddenly right on me and without a word, question or notice started to french kiss me.  I was stunned and picked him up by the shoulders and lifted him off me... asked him where his coat was - he said upstairs... I told him he was going to get his coat, while I was gathered up my stuff and left the bar - without him - to head home. I was in shock and literally ran out of the bar to the subway back to Brooklyn as fast as I could. ",A visiting student at the department of Anthropology,He was the Professor of three classes I was taking that term and the highest profile academic at the CUNY Grad Centre,Other Type of School,CUNY Graduate Centre,Anthropology - Marxist Geography,,"After much hand wringing as a long-standing activist on violence on women I decided I could not afford the consequences of taking on the most high profile academic in my field as a mature PhD student with entering the field in my fifties. As a lesbian of colour who wanted to be known for my own work not for taking down the top white male marxist in the field. Therefore I did not launch any official bureaucratic action but settled on a ""whisper campaign"" in which I would tell my feminist, progressive and racialized colleagues. I therefore told the head of the department, other women professors in the department and the field - many of whom were very angry and supportive, but said they could do nothing without me making a formal complaint. I discovered from a fellow student that many women students, particularly students of colour, had left the department as a result of persistent sexual harassment by the most high profile white male professors in the department. Another visiting fellow told me in confidence that the two highest profile white men in the department would openly compete with each other over which women students were in their ""stable."" A feminist professor told me my dark curly hair and brown skin were favoured by my harasser. Another fellow student said her sister who is a lesbian was also sexually propositioned by this same professor at an AAG conference. ",None materially... in spite of my sharing with high profile colleagues ,"I was surprised by the depth of the negative effects of this incident, how much it undermined my health, my work, and became an effective brake on my otherwise solid professional momentum.

Overall the incident lengthened my PhD work by at least six to seven years and caused so much stress and distress that I ended up with an autoimmune disease along with persistent depression and isolation in my academic field.,Thanks for doing this - your work on this is much appreciated.

I recall walking down the hall on my way to class one day and he walked by and made a comment about my boots, and how sexy they looked on me. I felt like I couldn't even dress my usual way. He got my cellphone number from one of my male classmates without my permission and called several times late at night, each time I said no to grabbing a drink and after that he gave up. I made it quite clear I was not interested. My roommate knew this was going on and she had heard another student in our program was going through the same thing and was going to report it. Fastforward 6 months I graduated and was working in a different city and got a call from that roommate. A group of female students from the university were wanting me to join then in reporting my experience because there were now a number of stories coming out about the guy.

We lunch together next Saturday and after that, we went to the bus stop and he said something and kissed me. I was really confused, I didn't know what to do. He said he did it because he perceived I was attracted to him, but I wasn't, I just admired him, it was just intelectual admiration and respect. He was really intimidating when he said that he ""perceived"" I was attracted to him, so I had no idea what to say in order to explain him I was not attracted to him without making him angry. I though that if I let it go and forget about it, he was also going to forget it. But the next week he ask me to go to his office to talk about my PhD admission and my PhD project. He actually didn't wanted to talk about that, he just made me sit on his lap and kissed me. I was really confused and I though that I had no choice but to ""follow the game"" becase asking him to stop behaving like that could cause me troubles with him. Of course, I didn't want troubles with him, he was not only going to be my PhD supervisor but he was also the Academic Secretary of our department (the most powerful guy after the director of the department). Shortly after that he said we should go for a coffee but he took me to his house.

So the first 18 months of my PhD I suffered his revenge because he devoted all his energy and power to make my life miserable, I suffered psychological abuse from him and I perceived rejection from many professors from our department.

He asked me a series of personal questions under the guise of offering spiritual direction. He asked explicitly about my divorce and current marital status, then raised his eyebrows and informed me that I certainly could be remarried by now. His class lectures frequently revolved around sex, which was unusual for a class in Christian Church History. He would say inappropriate things to the female students. One day he asked about what we think when a ‘hunk’ walks by. He would also make objectifying statements about women. When I complained about it he would tell me that some feminist theologians think that we need to be talking about push up bras and sexuality. He never respected me as a theologian and made clear his amusement of me, particularly when a male classmate made a disparaging remark towards me. My classmates look up to him and he has a good reputation in the community as a pastor. He claims to be a women’s advocate. I doubted my own experiences until he finally commented on my “slinky dress,” (I was wearing a modest sleeveless blouse behind a podium) in a photo of me at a public speaking event at a local  church. He also made fun of a mutual friend and colleague because I had expressed admiration for him as a chaplain (which is the field I’m preparing for.)

Both of my PhD supervisors were serial harassers of female students.  They were particularly aggressive toward the cohorts of young master’s students who cycled through the department each year and therefore were most likely to (a.) not be aware of previous histories, and (b.) try to simply tolerate or avoid the harassment as best as they could because they knew they would only be in the department for the one-year program (although I have little doubt these experiences in some cases terminated thoughts some of them might have had of continuing for a PhD in my department). As a male student who witnessed some incidents and had others confided to me, not all of these stories are mine to tell.  However, I will say that none of this behavior was remotely secret.  My advisors boasted openly about their constant pursuit of students and deliberately spread rumors about students they wanted to sleep with, were sleeping with, or had been unable to sleep with (the latter category of course being on the receiving end of some of the worst rumors).  They also boasted about having helped particularly fabulous looking students gain admission to the department, presumably meaning that students merely gifted with brains rather than with my advisors’ standards of youth and beauty would not have received such preferential treatment.  And of course since physical appearance and perceived pliability were the only attributes my advisors valued in women, they were loud and noxious misogynists when it came to speaking about the intellectual capabilities of female scholars.  No matter what superficially charming façade they might occasionally put on in mixed company, when they were among fellow white males (naturally they were bigots, too), any female scholar was deemed simply incapable, weak-minded, and unfit, regardless of whether she were a student or a Max Planck Institute director.  It was this level of presumption that all males must feel the same way and so there was no need to hide their behavior or beliefs among comrades that was probably a factor in the viciousness against me after I spoke up.  They simply could not believe that a fellow male would be so traitorous as to object to their actions – after all, they had never harassed me personally – never mind that someone would be insane enough to act in a way so obviously and terminally detrimental to my own career prospects in academia.

Apart from what I witnessed in my own department, I’ll just add a short note regarding my experiences in a non-academic career track after I finished my PhD. I am not an especially gregarious individual, and yet the number of times I have had professional women outside the academy confide to me their assault experiences during graduate study is both stunning and more than a little horrifying in view of how much of an undercount it must represent compared to the number of women who were understandably never inclined to share some of their worst life experiences with a random male colleague.  It must therefore always, ALWAYS be remembered that any sampling of sexual harassment and assault experiences within the academy is necessarily going to underestimate the scale of the problem because it will invariably under-sample women who left academia in part or entirely because of harassment.
",PhD student,"Both of my PhD supervisors held the rank of Senior Lecturer, which is roughly the British equivalent of an Associate Professor in the U.S.",Other R1,,History,,"My department chair angrily told me that he was already aware of female student complaints but of course wasn’t going to do anything about it.  He then declared I would no longer have the right to any PhD supervisor at all if I didn’t want to work with the serial harassers who were my assigned supervisors.  Presumably he thought this would be enough to keep me from finishing my dissertation (and since the department had already cashed the last of my external fellowship checks at this point, they were A-OK with that).  However, I fled the country, wrote up my dissertation from another institutional base, and then demanded to submit the dissertation for examination by an external committee, which was standard procedure under the British system where my department was.  At this point, the department chair tried to have himself reassigned as my official supervisor and thereby run out the clock on my university registration, despite the fact that his background was utterly irrelevant to my research and indeed farther away than any other member of the entire department.  One of my ex-supervisors suggested some of his drinking buddies as members of the dissertation examination committee.  Etc.  Etc.  Etc.  It was ugly.  Ultimately, I gained the right to submit my dissertation to an impartial examination committee and was passed for the PhD, and at this point I left academia and accepted a non-academic job.",Promotion.  Obviously.  Both of my ex-supervisors were rapidly promoted to the rank of full professor – a bigger deal under the British system than the American – and the department chair now has his own new department at another elite school.,I left academia and have had a varied career track including a short period in diplomatic service (where my first assigned mentor boasted of having given women higher scores on the Foreign Service oral exam if he liked their legs).,"Yeah, it’s hard.  I’m obviously extremely fortunate in that I never experienced any of the harassment or assault directly to myself and instead was only retaliated against in a non-physical manner for speaking out on behalf of others.  I never forget that this is by far the easier consequence.  Nevertheless, especially lately with harassment finally beginning to be taken more seriously and so many stories constantly in the news, it is really difficult to focus on work sometimes without spiraling into a whirlwind of old emotions.  It’s not helped by the fact that I recently started working again on research related to my old dissertation topic, and however much I may intellectually like the subject, it is still bound up with these ugly experiences from the past.  You never stop wondering if there was a different way of speaking up that might have been more successful at having an impact rather than just leading to you getting swatted aside like a meaningless insect.  Partly there is the question of what an alternative career outcome might have looked like, but these days I mostly wonder what my failure to actually take these assholes down fifteen years ago means for countless women they have encountered since then.  Shit, I’m tearing up even as I write this.","In the last 22 years of academic study and professional work, I have had a total of one two-and-a-half year job, one three-month fellowship, and one six-month fellowship that did not involve at least one of my superiors being at some level a harasser or embezzler. Even in the very rare cases where I can genuinely say that my outspokenness did contribute to a modest degree of change, it only happened after I had been successfully squashed and driven out, at which point changes were quietly implemented later.  At this point, I am unemployed and emotionally beaten down by the experiences of the past couple of decades but extraordinarily lucky to have a wife with a successful career and therefore to have the opportunity to take a bit of a respite from the workplace.  Can I just make one request to those of you continuing academics, though?  I know you’re all terribly busy (contrary to the plethora of shallow hack jobs and opinion pieces in the press) and that you get a lot of random queries from random people.  Nevertheless, sometimes that “independent scholar” who writes to you with a quick question or solicitation for advice is only an independent scholar because they once took it hard on the chin in an effort to make your own workplace a bit safer.  Perhaps hear us out occasionally if you have time and if we’re serious and respectful, because under only slightly different circumstances of fortune, it really could have been you sitting in our place.",,Male

I was laughed at in lab meetings and my work was largely ignored. In 2008, I took a research internship at Harvard University (I applied largely to get away from my own lab) but this must have elicited some jealousy because the day after this internship was confirmed, I was suddenly accused of data falsification by my advisor. He didn't approach me, he went straight to the dean of Research. My PhD was put on hold while I underwent a 10 month investigation. There was no basis to his claim, and afterwards I was fully exonerated. Turns out the university was also investigating my advisor at the same time for a potential affair with his other student.

12/7/2017 6:29:25,"I have three instances to report. I was a clinical social worker in health care at a top university in Canada. I did individual, partner , family and group counselling. I was considered a leader in my field of end of life care. The first incident was with a surgeon I worked with. After 2 years of powerful work with clients and their families, my colleague, a married man with several adult children, asked me to meet him for lunch and said he would ""no longer take no for an answer"". He had never asked me for lunch before nor been anything but professional in his behaviour. That should have been my first clue that he felt I was part of his secret life. We went to lunch and I have to say my concern was for his health and well being. I thought he was struggling with something and needed a compassionate ear. At lunch he proposed to me that he buy me : a hospice building and licensing so we could continue to do this work of end of life care. He also offered to pay all the hospice expenses, buy me a condo , a car, and anything else I needed. I was shocked. I asked what he would expect in return for all this generosity and he said :""only that you make yourself available 24/7 to speak to me"". I had been a model in my younger years and was quite familiar with the world of what men and women can get themselves into without occupational boundaries. I was single at the time, having left my husband. I said : ""what if I am with someone and you call to talk"". He said :""you will ask them to leave"". I told him that I was flattered by his wish to access my mind at such an expense to him but that even though he was offering me everything I needed, I was a woman who needed her own independence and so could not agree to this. He then refused to work with me, went to the organizations CEO and tried to discredit me. I was taken off this cancer service and placed in another service , less enjoyable to me. I felt threatened and at risk. I was told by my supervisor to stay in my office and become the best clinician I could become. Security was notified. The surgeon then began an anonymous letter campaign to threaten the surgeon who headed the service i worked on. The surgeon who began this was eventually let go but I had experienced violence and intimidation and coercion in the workplace. I was strong enough to say no but suffered occupational harassment, personal threat, sidetracking of my career and I felt a sense of public shaming by his rife comments when I passed him in the hall.

The second incident was a senior neurologist at the university I worked at. He was seeing me as my physician in a dr-patient relationship. I saw him over years. I choose to switch my care from him to another physician when he began to make suggestions that I was sexualizing the relationship ( I have severe pain from a motor vehicle accident and was seeking his opinion on this. it is hard to sexualize anything when you have that level of pain). I was shocked by this, and simply left after an incident where I felt he had said something to his secretary about me that was sexualizing of me as patient. Some ten years later, after I left, he was brought up on charges of sexual harrassment by another client, and these charges resulted in his being fined and having him retire. I think I was witness to this old man loosing his filters....and it went on for some time before someone else called him on it.

The third incident is another misuse of power by men. My medical director in end of life care wanted me to support his efforts to bring in a change in policy at a federal level for end of life care. I beleive in the right to your own ideas and freedom of speech in my academic world. I told him I could not support him. I was then head hunted to an international agency in oncology and palliative care in Europe. It was a think tank for cancer care. Upon my return from meeting with the UN about pain managment being a human right, and meeting with this think tank in Switzerland, my elite program on family care was collapsed by this physician-because I would not do as he asked. 

My program was income generating and a top clinical program. He was trying to silence my voice as its leadership was well recognized. He was a physician and a medical director. I was a director of a psycho-social-spiritual team or family therapy team. We were both top notch players-but I had the international reputation more than he did. 

He collapsed my program, fired my team, kept on those he could control , hired some of my students who would end up leaving for the same reason I did ( his determining of their practice). What was most interesting was that he asked me to write a paper for publication. I did and heard nothing back. I then asked about it and he said he had lost the paper. 10 years after I wrote that paper, 5 years after I left him employment, one of my medical students ( graduate level) found a published curriculum which gave me second authorship. The first authorship was his. He had taken my paper and published it under his name. I would never have found it unless my student brought it to my attention. 

All three men, tried to cull my career and use/misuse my presence and abilities. ",Assistant Professor moving to Associate Professor.,"Doctors : surgical oncologist, neurologist ( top neurologist), family physician",Elite Institution/Ivy League,,"Social work, theologian ",,"In the first case, I was moved to another service, protected but very much felt 
an attempt to discredit me personally ( they could not do this professionally) . The incident was viewed as a personal issue when it was not. It was oppression, sexual oppression.

Second case, I did not complain but in retrospect i should have said something so others would not be hurt. I did not speak out because the neurologist was the best in his field and I felt it was me who was inspiring his interest as I felt he had heard ( misheard) about the (non-) relationship with the surgeon . Both worked in the same institution. Even if the first incident/case/episode had been real and mutual, it would not have and should not have led to an assumption by the second physician that i would be open to turning my need for health care into a sexual relationship.

Third case, it took a lot of work. MY work was severed and I received a package from my employer at the hospital. I was retained by the University but I did not receive my Associate professorship as all the documentation for this process was thrown out by the Medical Director. I had no recourse and no fight left in me to pursue this. I continue to work with the University. 

I took the surgeon to the College of Physicians and Surgeons who usually only hear complaints from consumers. I knew the physician in this third case was unwell as I used to sit with him in the emergency department when he was brought in by ambulance after an episdoe of wandering. After his insistence that I support legislation and policies I did not feel I could support, I identified my concerns about his judgment and use of power. He was removed from his Medical Directorship but placed in a key position in a center for ethics. My concern about his behaviour had gone to this centre in writing. I feel he went there to destroy any evidence of my concerns. I do not know this for a fact...but I hypothesize this. It took me 10 years but I got first authorship on the curriculum published by the DFCM at the university. This physician would die a few years after the original incident. I think I lost close to $500,000 .00 in salary as I never found the strength to place myself back into a top level job because of the co-ercision I experienced from these 3 physicians.  I went on to be purposeful and a leader in my field-but suffered deeply for their behaviours and solicitations and mis use of power.","The first case, the surgeon , was fired but allowed to continue with his work. He has since died.
The second case, the neurologist, practiced until someone took exception to his behaviour and filed a complaint and won with the College of Physicians and Surgeons. He is now retired as a result of the successful complaint. 
The third case, the physician was promoted, then died.No discreditation or repremend.","Significant loss of income and status, demoralization, hesitation to continue building my career in such a sexually harrassing and controlling environment as the ""Boyz club"".","I am sure it has taken its toll-but two of the physicians are dead and I am still alive. I did have two strokes during this time ( 2001,2005) and I would say this had an impact on my longevity. I am 66 years of age now, still working , partially by choice but partially because I have to as my career trajectory went sideways because of these situations cited and I want to continue to maintain my own lifestyle so small amounts of work help.",Quality of life changed dramatically with loss of income ( I was very well paid). Stress in the family. Strokes effected me deeply.,"I am not wanting to give you my name and my institution as I am a public figure and still continue to teach-but mostly because these incidents left me with such a level of distress I am concerned any further opening of this will cause me another stroke.This is a real consequence for me. 

 I hope you can use this information . I am not a victim-I stood strong in these scenarios-but I would have rather put the effort into helping others than protect and defend myself. 

In my day, at the Jewish Hospital I worked at ( I was not Jewish) the men would say that non-Jewish women were the women you ""practiced on"" before you went home to your wife and had great sex with her. It was in this climate I worked and all three men were Jewish by culture and religion. I was shocked by the pervasive sexualization in the first two cases....and the misuse of gender and power in the third. I hope you will understand I have had enough of living in this soup of deception that was created by the men involved. I hope your work brings change for the next generation. I am so proud of your call for people to speak. ",Male

About a year into my marriage, I was a full time student working two jobs and supporting a husband who had quit his job, who told me he did not support my goal of graduate school. I opted out of that situation for my own good, but did not have family support. I sought advice / legal referral from an undergrad professor. He offered me a paid position in the writing center (my third job) which helped me with expenses. During that time, I was propositioned repeatedly by this professor, who clearly knew I was in a vulnerable spot. Later I heard of his proclivity for dating students. I was uncomfortable asking him for a recommendation letter for graduate school, so ended up taking an additional course, post-graduation, with a different professor to get the third recommendation. Five years later, while in graduate school in a different state, I heard from another student the rumor that everyone “knew” I had dated this professor. Fast forward twenty years, that rumor is alive and well in this small town.  From what I can piece together, it likely originates from this professor. He is tenured and still teaching.

This pales in comparison to what happened with this same supervisor (also her supervisor), to my good friend ""L"": he asked about her status, she ignored it. Conversation changed to how to pay bills... she said she worked in a bar to pay the bills, he hit on her, said something along the lines of 'women like you' and asked her about going to conferences because 'he and his wife had a deal that whatever happens at conferences stays at conferences'. He also normalized student-prof sexual affairs by saying 'he'd done it before'. L called me in absolute panic - neither of us had defended and still had to work with him for roughly a year afterwards.  He was later discovered to have plagiarized from a student's PhD defence for his book, and somehow, never lost his job despite that blatant breach of ethics, despite his sexual harassment.

12/7/2017 8:02:21,"A male colleague, another graduate student in my department, had apparently been talking to others in the department about his fantasies concerning me and his girlfriend. I am gay and was open about it. On a class field trip that required a stay of several nights in a hotel he was put in charge of making hotel reservations. He attempted to manipulate the hotel rooms so that it would put me in the same room as his girlfriend where I guess he thought we would inevitably act out his fantasies.

12/7/2017 8:06:29,"During my Masters I was required to program an experiment using Matlab. I had no experience with this whatsoever and very little time in which to write the code, but my supervisor insisted that it had to be done this way (I was hoping to have him as my advisor for the PhD program the following year so I wanted to impress him). 

I was approached by a PhD student who had offered to help me write the code, in exchange for authorship on a future paper that would arise from the project. I agreed, and we also negotiated payment from my supervisor to write the code. It started out well, with the student assuring me that he could write the code in one week. However, he then began requesting that I sit with him whilst he put the code together. I desperately needed the code so I could conduct my research work (which formed my dissertation project for the year), so I would come in and sit with him (sometimes this would be in the middle of the night as he said he could only code then). During this time, he would make lots of sexually explicit comments about me, which I laughed off and ignored in the hopes that he would finish the coding. He would then guilt me into going for drinks with him at the end of the day, and threaten to stop writing the code unless I went with him. I went along with this, trying to act professionally in the hopes that he would just do the work. This ended up going on for the best part of 2 months, which was absolutely emotionally exhausting. 

Eventually, I had enough of his behaviour and began to hint at him that I was in a relationship in the hopes that the inappropriate comments would stop. This led to him berating me for ""leading him on"" and suggested that I let everyone know about my relationship status when I first meet them so that I don't confuse people in the future. He then started to belittle me in the lab in front of other (male) researchers and suggested that I was too emotional to be a scientist/shouldn't bother because as a female I would never be as good as my male colleagues. He then continued to harass me for about 6 months, showing up randomly at my house/my office/events I was attending. Eventually I had to finish writing my thesis at home to avoid him.

12/9/2017 7:20:36,"After completing my BA and MA at an institution where students and professors did not socialize together, I did my PhD in at an institution that was very informal. It was a bit of a learning curve adjusting to a world in which professors and grad students hung out together, but I found the informality of my new school refreshing. At the orientation, my soon to be harasser walked by a group of new students and said ""are there any [students in my field] in here?"" and then instructed us all to call him by his first name. I loved that. My harasser was irreverent. He swore, wore jeans, and in general shook things up. He drank with his students, spent his free time outside of classes with us, and read my whole MA thesis to learn more about my research. I thought he was exactly what I wanted in a dissertation supervisor: someone invested in me and my work. He was a father to two young women, and I found him incredibly paternal. He looked out for grad students and would often pay for our meals and drinks. He agreed to be my supervisor. I went to Italy the summer of my first year, and when I came back, he took me and my friend for drinks. I remember that night he asked me how to say ""will you @#$%^& me"" in Italian. I brushed it off. That semester, I was applying for fellowships. I asked him if he would write me a letter of recommendation, and he agreed. He asked to meet to go over my CV, but I was worried that if we went out he would pay for everything again (like he always did), and I wanted to show that I was grateful for his time, so I invited him over to my house for dinner. I lived close to campus and couldn't drive, and he didn't have a car at the time, so it seemed like the best option. (I couldn't very well suggest we meet somewhere neither of us could get to without difficulty; my PhD institution was in the middle of nowhere). Also, the culture of the program was so informal that I didn't see anything wrong with this gesture. My roommates were home, and I had a boyfriend at the time. I wasn't worried about him. That night, he came over with a two-liter bottle of wine and proceeded to get very drunk. We talked about my work over dinner, and at the end, I got up to do the dishes. I felt him come up behind me and wrap his arms around my waist and start rubbing my hips. I moved to break away and pretended it never happened. Then, as we sat down, he said ""I'm going to be bad,"" and leaned forward to kiss me. I moved my head away. He tried again, and I remember his lips made contact with mine. I got up and suggested we go somewhere else--perhaps bike over to a bar. We agreed to bike to the one bar on campus and I went to grab a jacket and change my pants to ones I could bike in. When I came back into the room, he said he was just going to go home. At the time, I didn't quite understand what had happened that night. I know—first and foremost--I felt bad for him. I was sure that because he was a father, he would wake up sober and feel terrible. I called my father, sister, and former supervisor, and we all agreed that keeping quiet and my head down would be best. But he spent the next six years terrorizing me. I dropped him off my committee, because I realized I could no longer work with him, and he told other professors in my department that we were no longer working together because I had plagiarized his work. (We work on completely different things). He went out of his way to make me feel small and pick on me as I made my way through my exams and prospectus phase. Then, things got much worse. Since I no longer had a supervisor, I began working—in name, at least—with the soon-to-be retired professor in my department who was in my field. When he retired, they hired someone new--a woman--and my harasser began dating her. Before I knew they had started dating, she and I chatted about my work, and she agreed to be my new supervisor. It made sense: she was the fancy new professor, and I couldn't keep working with someone who had retired. Also, she was a good and careful reader of my work, and I became quite fond of her. I dreaded that she would find out what her boyfriend did to me years ago, and at some point it did come out. I asked her to keep details of my job search from him, and to keep him away from me when she could. She didn't treat me differently, and I was grateful for that.

But my last two years of grad school were deeply traumatizing. My harasser, probably emboldened by his relationship with my new supervisor, made my life a constant hell. When we were doing mock interviews for the job market, he volunteered to interview me. Multiple professors intervened, and he allegedly went around the department accusing me of slandering him. He showed up to my dissertation defense even though he was asked by multiple professors not to, glowered at me, grunted throughout, and then left in the middle. The worst came when I got a job offer at an excellent school (where I am now). I gave them--over the phone--my intent to accept, and asked them to send me a contract. At the same time, I emailed a school at which I was still under consideration to tell them of the offer. At that time, they told me I was first in line for their job as well. (Apparently, they made an offer to a woman, who, although originally accepting, had rescinded her acceptance. I emailed my supervisor and our university’s job placement committee chair to ask what to do. It was late at night, and I wanted to know if I should negotiate with the first school, and whether or not I could recommend my friend to the second school. Before I even had a chance to write back to the second school, my harasser had written to them about his own student. He had found out the search had reopened, and wrote to them that night. This was extremely embarrassing for me, because nobody but me knew the search was back open, and it was obvious that the information had come from me. It was also horrible that I didn't have the chance to tell school #2 that I was accepting another offer before he wrote to them on behalf of “our school”—so I was told—and for his student, whom they hadn't even interviewed. This was the last straw for me. I went, crying, to my supervisor's office, and then to the DGS, who told me that everyone knew my harasser was a sociopath, and that he wouldn't direct any more graduate students if he could help it. Nothing happened on this last point, of course. He is still directing graduate students.

We connected on social media and messaged back-and-forth a bit, including after the class had ended.

12/7/2017 15:23:41,"I was accepted to Duke University in January of 2014. I matriculated in the Fall of that year. I had previously completed a Masters degree in American history, the field I intended to pursue with Laura Edwards, who would have been my advisor. Within the first few months of working together, it became apparent that Professor Edwards was not comfortable with my research topic, or with me. I have epilepsy, which has primarily presented as petit mal seizures and is controlled by medication. The first indication I had that my working relationship with Professor Edwards was not going well occurred in a phone conversation. She told me that I should jettison my M.A. thesis for a side project that I had created in matter of weeks. She became irritated when, confused, I asked a number of questions. “If you want to bring sexual violence back in,” she said, “do that. People write about it because it’s trendy.” I was horrified. After a long silence, she said, “You know I am joking.” “Yes” I said, “I know you are joking,” not really able to understand the exchange we were having. 

A few weeks later, I told her I needed to talk about doing primary source research in Georgia. I had, in essence, written two MA theses, one of which I had graduated with, and the other I offered as my admissions essay. Since Professor Edwards did not approve of my research on sexual violence, I tried to bring our attention to my work on local courts in Western Georgia. If this work was to be the focus of my dissertation, however, I was going to need on-site access to court records. I would need to drive. Even if, in the course of our work together, we decided a working with a more centralized archive was preferable, I needed her to make an informed decision. So I told Professor Edwards of my condition, and informed her that I cannot drive. I asked her advice, strictly in regard to research. She was hostile. She would not have a conversation, and repeatedly suggested that in fact, I could drive. It was not until at least three meeting later that I flatly told her “driving is off the table, it will not happen.” She told me that she had “grown up poor,” that no one had believed in her, and that I should therefore find a way to make my situation work. I reiterated that I could not, in fact, drive, that it is illegal for me to drive, and that I wanted nothing from her except advice on how to successfully research in my particular situation. As is procedure, I spoke with our Director of Graduate Studies (DGS), who largely belittled me.
In the spring, I was assigned (by the same DGS) to work as T.A. for a known harasser, Dean Wilson. This man sat next to me and sang songs about fraternity brothers impregnating sorority girls. He joked about an actress who was in a car accident, making comments about her breasts. On my first day in his class, when I (and my fellow T.A.) sat down, he said to the class “they sure look interesting, don’t they? But we will find out if they are. We will find out if they have anything to say.” He let (mostly male) students question my grades and my authority in the classroom to the point that I really was nothing more than his secretary. I complained, repeatedly. He was considered immovable.
I went through much of that first year in Grad school essentially without an advisor. I should note that, while students often do not formally declare an advisor until their second year, most do have informal relationships with Professors, and all receive the benefit of some kind of mentorship. I went without this for nearly all of my first year. Midway through the second semester of my first year, I took a course with Professor William Reddy, who agreed to become my advisor. This move entailed, however, a radical shift in focus, and with that, a huge amount of work. I changed my field from American history to European, and with the help of Professor Reddy, formulated a new research topic, specializing in 18th century France and the history of emotions. It began to look as though I was through the worst. Professor Reddy and I started to pull together a dissertation committee. My grades were flawless. I was genuinely interested in my new field. I missed my old work, and was still hurt and confused by Professor Edward’s behaviour, but I wanted to move forward. Professor Reddy suggested that I enroll in Professor Jenhangir Malegam’s seminar, and ask him to serve on my committee. I did. This was a terrible mistake. After about four class sessions, Professor Malegam expelled me from his class. I was the only woman in the class. He sent everyone out of the room except me, came back in, and began an argument with me, much of which, unfortunately, I don’t remember. I do know that he told me “You don’t need to be here” and told me that he would withdraw me from his course. He also told me he would not be on my committee, a statement, that, while it seems obvious enough, is, in the context of a small department, intended to convey that he will be do his part to see that I do not progress toward graduation. The only explanations he offered were 1) that I typed too loudly and 2) I had paused too long before answering a question. I believe that my disclosure to Professor Edwards influenced Professor Malegam’s behavior. Even if evidence of this is lacking, the fact that, by this point, most of the department was aware of my health status made it nearly impossible for me to complain about what was happening. I was a pariah.

I assumed, however, that the department would, at the very least, form a committee to investigate, or perhaps offer mediation. There was nothing. This is still the worst part of this situation to me. Absolutely no one, apart from my own advisor, cared about this in the least. It was a career-breaking move, and it was meant to be. The following fall, I enrolled in a required pedagogy course and (also required) methods course. Though I did well in both of these courses, I had to work harder than my peers, and was the subject of a good deal of mockery in my methods course. This was a direct result of the fact that 1) I had to change focus in yr. 1 and 2) I had been withdrawn from a course in yr. 2 and therefore been deprived of a research/writing opportunity. Therefore, in year 3, when I took our required grant writing/ portfolio preparation course, I was lagging behind my peers. The complaint here is that the department knew what had happened, knew they had not addressed it, knew that it was quantifiably slowing my progress to degree, and, nevertheless, placed the burden on me. They did this not only in the sense that they refused to change deadlines, there were also numerous subtle barbs in the classroom. For instance, when I offered my proposal for workshop, the professor, Philip Stern, mocked the use of French text, saying “Now you are just showing off” and encouraged other students to do the same. Perhaps it does not need to be said, but the dissertation is about France. This is common practice. The underlying assertion of Professor Stern’s statement is that I am too stupid to be doing the work I am doing, and something is out of joint.

Finally, I was pressured out because 1) it became clear that there would be no relenting on the timeline – it would remain the same, despite the fact that others had made mistakes, not me, and despite the fact that those errors had never been internally adjudicated. I was essentially forced to take a semester leave, because without it, I could not have passed Professor Stern’s methods course. The reason I could not have passed it was that I needed a (pre-existing) research paper in order to do so. My peers didn’t have this problem, but Professor Malegam had thrown me out the course where I would have written this paper. So, in order to avoid an F on my record, I gave up a semester worth of funding. 2) My advisor let me know that the department had little to no intention of funding me any longer than they were contractually obligated to. That time was coming soon. He said, and I believed, that my work was very good, and could be funded. There is limited funding for French historians, however, and it is even more limited for those historians in the early stages of their careers. My choices were: a) fund myself for a while until that eventuality, and then let Duke take credit for my work or b) save the money and emotional effort. I chose b, but it cost me a lot of pain.

One faculty member stepped up and helped, but then began putting increasing pressure on me to spend more time with her and to talk about details of my personal life. I appeased her, but the demands and threats of retaliation increased. She isolated me from colleagues, spreading rumors about me, and threatening to withdraw her support in an increasingly difficult department if I didn't give her the time and attention she wanted. Finally she lured me into a meeting in her car, where she sexually assaulted me. I refused to let her into my office after that, and so she retaliated by stalking and harassing me at home late at night, threatening my wife and friends. When I called 911 they said that they couldn't come out if there wasn't an active threat (phone calls and text messages weren't enough). I reported to title IX who negotiated an agreement between us. She now regularly retaliates against my graduate students by refusing them normal assistance that other faculty members give to students. She has stuck to the letter of the negotiated agreement, though, and so I don't feel like I can ask for more help navigating this.

12/7/2017 17:19:00,"In 2012 I was a postdoc and attended a national conference out of state. On the last day of the conference, at the conference dinner, I sat at a table of people I did not previously know. During dinner, I spoke at length with the man sitting next to me, who worked in a different area than I and who was at mid-career academic status. We talked about our research, our universities (we worked in the same state in different cities), and our families. As I often do, I mentioned my husband multiple times throughout our conversation-- partly because I like talking about him and I'm very proud of what he does but also to make it clear that I was married and not interested in talking to this person for any other reason than professional interest. This man also talked about his wife and family. I had no reason to suspect that our conversation was perceived by him as anything other than professional. After dinner, some colleagues that I knew were moving on with a group to a nearby bar, and this man I had been speaking with at dinner joined us to walk over. When we got to the bar, people ordered drinks then sat down at tables-- this man came and sat next to me, and many other colleagues were sat around the table. Shortly after we sat down, he discreetly moved his hand back to my rear end and began jamming his thumb between my buttocks. I was startled and jumped slightly, shocked that this was happening at all, especially in a crowded table full of academics. I reached my hand down and forcefully pushed his hand away. He then turned to me and said ""are you going to stay here"", and I said ""yes, I am"". He looked disappointed. He again touched my rear end and jammed his thumb between my buttocks. Again I pushed it away forcefully. At this stage he got up from the table. I was terrified and wanted to leave, but it would have meant walking back to my nearby hotel, and I was scared that he would follow me to my hotel. I looked around and realized that all of the colleagues in the room whom I knew well were male, and I didn't want to ask one of them to walk with me back to the hotel because I thought that would sound weird. I didn't feel I knew any of them well enough to tell them what had happened. I was scared. I leaned over to the woman (whom I did not know) across from me at the table and began engaging her in conversation about her research, hoping that the man had left, and I could wait a while then walk back to my hotel. Unfortunately, he came back with another drink and sat next to me. He discreetly tried to touch me on my rear end and jam his thumb up me a few more times. I pushed his hand away and kept talking to the woman across from me, trying not to pay him any attention. He got up and went to the bathroom, then came back, sat down one more time, and asked me again if I was going to stay there or if I wanted to leave. I said I was going to stay there. He looked visibly annoyed, and after another minute or so, got up, announced he was leaving, and walked out. My heart was racing. I still didn't want to leave on my own in case he was hanging around outside the bar. So I decided I would stay there and wait until some of the group that I knew headed back to the hotel where we were staying. I continued to try to engage in conversation with the people around me, but I was almost shaking with fear. I had never been assaulted like this before, and I was in shock that someone had tried to do this in a professional setting, in a crowded room full of colleagues. Eventually, people started to leave, and I walked back to my hotel with two male colleagues that I knew well, quickly locking myself into my hotel room to break down and cry. My flight was the next day, and I stayed in my hotel room until the last possible moment I needed to leave to go to the airport, terrified that I might see this man again. Once I was home, I broke down, hysterically crying, and explained to my husband what had happened. I felt so unsafe, so violated, and so discouraged for a long time. I purposefully avoided the city where the event took place for the next two years, avoiding going to any conferences or seminars there. The man didn't even live in that city or state, but I was traumatized by what had happened there. I received an email from the man about a week after the incident, sent to my institutional email address. He said that he had had too much to drink and he apologized for anything inappropriate that he said or did. I was disgusted even seeing an email from him, and immediately deleted it. I never told any of my academic colleagues about the incident. I was scared at the time that accusations might be made that it was inappropriate for us to be in a bar drinking, even though it was a group situation and I had started out the evening thinking everything was professional and above board. I didn't know what to do. I was scared people would not believe me or take me seriously. Also, he was at a different university, and the incident had occurred at an out of town conference. Even if I had wanted to report the incident, I didn't know if I should talk to my university, his, or the conference organization where the incident had taken place. About a year later, I did a university survey on bullying and sexual harassment in the workplace. I responded that yes, I had been sexually harassed, but I did not give any further details. The university did not follow up with me on my response. This is the first time I've recounted what happened at length. My heart is racing even now, 5 years later, as I write about it. I have never felt such helplessness as I did that night. And it has changed the way I interact with colleagues at academic conferences and in my academic workplace. I am wary of everyone, and I put up a wall so that conversations don't get too in depth about anything. That's a shame, because I'm probably missing out on some great opportunities to connect with new colleagues. It gets better with time, though, and I am slowly learning to trust again that I can have a professional conversation in a professional setting with a man in my profession without the possibility of being sexually assaulted.

Now, I still get slightly nervous at conference dinners or academic social events, and I am very wary of engaging with people for too long at such events.

12/7/2017 17:48:50,"This incident occurred during a thesis defense in a room full of about 100 people, including faculty, students, post-docs, and also the student’s colleagues, friends, and family members. Traditionally, upon graduation, the student’s thesis advisor will introduce the defending student prior to the research talk. I recently witnessed a graduating female student be introduced by her thesis advisor in the most inappropriate way. To provide a bit of background, a common technique in the field and that is commonly used in this particular lab is the use of light suction, typically applied by mouth into a pipette, to open and record currents in brain cells. His whole introduction of her revolved around how he knew she would be successful in his lab because she had an oral obsession. The slide he showed actually had a title along the lines of “orally obsessed” and showed photos of the student making sour expressions and playing a wind instrument. 

The entire room was detectably uncomfortable, people were visibly squirming in their chairs, uncomfortably laughing, and looking away.  The student ignored the introduction and gave one of the most thoughtful and comprehensive talks I have ever attended, which was her only option given that looking visibly shaken would have thrown her off balance. It is unfortunate, though, that the expectation was for her to remain poised and unmoved despite the clearly sexist introduction.  

What was most saddening was the fact that this person, who has just earned a doctoral degree in a STEM field, had her family, friends, and colleagues there to celebrate her PROFESSIONAL merits and her advisor introduces her in a sexist and deeply unprofessional way. After that I only spoke about the incident with female colleagues and classmates, but I wish there was a way that this issue could be addressed at an institutional level, with this type of behavior set as an example of what not to do. This is a tenured professor that is close to retirement, so people shrug it off as “this is just one person and the problem will disappear when he’s gone.” But this is an institutional problem and many men in positions of power think that as long as they are not raping someone, they are falling in line with the rules of professionalism. As chronicled by this survey, sexual harassment in the workplace takes many forms and it deeply impacts a person’s sense of safety and ability to be successful in academia. 
",Graduate Student ,Faculty,Elite Institution/Ivy League,"University of California, San Francisco ",Neuroscience ,,none,"none, this is a tenured professor close to retirement that has a history with making inappropriate comments, usually directed towards women. While he has previously sent a letter of apology to the program for certain comments the ""apology"" consisted of: I-apologize-if-you-were-offended-type. Plus, given this more recent event it is clear that he did not fully understand what he did wrong. This does not surprise me given that the consequences have been analogous to a slap on the wrist. ","I love the idea of pursuing a career in Science, but question whether academia is the right career track for me given that there is still limited acknowledgement that harassment is even a problem. ","Science & academia has been built to be a boys club, and women in Science stand on this  foundation often not attuned to the fact that academia as an institution was not built for us. And we think there might be something wrong with us because we don't fit the mold, which impacts our mental health.

12/7/2017 18:39:45,"A now former chair and long time member of an art department (who is also an internationally known artist) consistently harassed and molested students and faculty within his department and in affiliated departments as well. He was most known for touching women without consent at the bar where he held his ""office hours"" and at department parties. The culture of the faculty and students in the associated departments revolved around whispering about the powerful professor's alleged actions. His reputation appeared to be decades in the making, and perhaps followed him from his previous teaching institutions. Though there are surely dozens of undisclosed cases that involve this individual, I am able to speak to two specific events that involved friends (fellow graduate students) and faculty members who are primary sources. In January of 2014, this individual molested two of of his graduate students at the bar during the first week of their second semesters in their graduate program. In both assaults, which occurred within an hour of each other and in public but hidden from view, he forced his hand into their pants and underwear, and in one instance repeatedly tried to grab the student's ,  When the incident was divulged to a senior faculty member and acting dean of students, a secret meeting was held with both of the students, the abusive faculty member, and the senior faculty, who proceeded to make list of rules that the abuser must follow as a resolution to the issue. The entire issue was swept under the rug and the abusive professor continued to teach for another year, advised students, sat on committees, and though his list of rules stipulated that office hours at the bar were no longer permitted, the abusive faculty member was unfazed and continued to regularly convene with students there. My friends, desperate to find justice, were advised to wait until they had solidified their degrees before reporting the incidents to the university. Neither of them shared any information about the abuse until Fall semester 2015, when one of them broke down after finding out that the abusive faculty member had When their degrees were signed in 2015 (one had to have her abuser's signature in order to graduate), they reported using proper channels. The HR representatives seemed as though they had been waiting for their statements, which led me to believe that they had been investigating the matter previously. After long and arduous plans were made by HR to file a university lawsuit against the professor using the accusations of my friends as a basis, the abusive professor was somehow allowed to disappear under the excuse of ""retirement"". He vanished from the department without a trace after decades of teaching and extreme influence. The case was dropped. No statements were made in regards to his sudden absence, though terrible misogynist rumors spread like wild fire amongst the departments, and his those who protected him before his removal became more adamant in their refusal to hear or admit to his indiscretions. I attended the initial HR meeting as a supportive shoulder for my friends, and my active participation in care, coupled with my vocal dissent of the abuser to other graduate students, landed me on a blacklist for my final year of my graduate program. Faculty members made evident their allegiances by committing conspiracy of secrecy after the abuser was ""vanished"" from the university. The majority of those who belonged to his camp- faculty who had once been friendly, cordial and actively engaged in my studies, including the chair of my committee, stopped speaking to me and refused to look me in the eye. During this period of growing disillusionment (with nearly every faculty member that I had worked with during my graduate career), I attended a spring semester (2016) gathering at the home of the then-Director of Graduate studies for the affiliate department in which I was a student.  While casually discussing interdepartmental politics, the subject of sexual harassment and the unexplained absence of the abusive professor was broached by the DGS. As I began to openly and explicitly explain the details of the January 2014 bar incident (the students involved had asked for the story to be discussed factually and publicly at the time), the DGS looked startled. She spoke in a hushed tone to myself and three other students, admitting that the abusive professor in question had molested her in exactly the same fashion (groping her vagina) during a faculty party when she first started teaching at the University in 2009. Her take away had been to diminish the action as negligible, detaching herself entirely, and continued to assert that instances of harassment or abuse would not be something that she would not let affect her career or her reputation. . I begged her to see why her non-action had led to years of continued abusive behavior, and specifically asked, ""If you had wanted to help a student in this situation, what would you do?"" Her response indicated that she seemed to find my concern for the wellbeing of students to be naive and overly sensitive. Though the specific incident of student abuse occurred almost four years ago, and the complaints/reports were made during 2014-2015, and the professor has been ""retired"" for a year of time, there has not been any kind form of formal or informal public address from the department, university, or community members regarding this situation.

I was an undergraduate and he was my professor, major advisor, honors thesis advisor, and one of my letter writers for my graduate school applications--so he had a ton of power and influence over me. It started when I was working with him on some research over the summer. Since it was summer, we met more often than we would have during the school year and the office where his building was located was even more deserted than normal. When we would meet, he would often sit next to me on the same side of the table rather than across the table or perpendicular to me. The door to his office was often closed. He sometimes offered me a coat or blanket to cover me up. This made me feel very uncomfortable because I was afraid he would try to touch me underneath the blanket. He once touched the hair on the back of my head when he was sitting next to me. He pressured me into going out to coffee or dinner with him three times that I can remember. On one occasion in particular he talked to me about how he had a crush on a professor when he was in undergrad. I don't remember the details, but that was described as a very positive experience and it very much felt like he was trying to draw a parallel between that relationship and ours. He often talked about his children but he never talked about his wife to the point that I remember thinking he must have been divorced. He was not.

12/7/2017 18:46:23,"Fall 2015, I started my PhD in a new program in the same college where I need received my masters. I was at an orientation get-together for new and current grad students at a local restaurant/bar. Only one prof showed up, but he was drunk, high, and disheveled when he showed up. I thought he was another grad student. 

I didn't chat much with him because I felt his presence, especially in the inebriated condition he was in, was inappropriate. It wasn't long before he made small talk, we discussed the upcoming semester, he assumed I was taking his philosophy course, but I hadn't told him I wasn't because I'd already had philosophy in my masters program. He asked how I felt about the program and I told him I thought I'd have a good time. He smirked, grabbed his beer, chuckled a bit, and said ""I'll make sure of it"" as he took a sip. 

I was so shocked, I sat there for 5 minutes trying to decide if I heard him correctly. My 14yo daughter was there so I got up and we left. The professor said ""see you in class"" and I told him I wouldn't be there. He was shocked and we left. 

I come from tech and am used to off-color comments, but for some reason, this threw me. After a few days I started taking to folks. One, a grad student who was friends with the prof tried to blow it off, ""he always says that, it is nothing!"" And I kept asking myself, and that student, since when does that excuse the behavior? 

Another grad student, male, described a situation where in the philosophy class I was not taking, he witnessed the prof being affectionate toward the female grad students, who happened to be primarily Asian. Then the Prof boasted of his sexual conquests with female Asian grad students in the past to my friend while walking to the bar for class (he held class in the local bars all the time). I was going to let his behavior toward me pass, 

I ended up calling a prof friend in my program and described this whole situation to her. She said they've had suspicion this was happening but no one willing to report it officially. So she suggested I go to the department chair and grad director. I did and they were very supportive and understanding, suggested I go to the Title IX office and file a complaint. It's worth noting that by this time i started feeling depressed.

I filed my report and the Title IX  office kept losing track of it's progress. Nearly six months later and they finally determined that the words the prof spoke we're harmless, he admitted to speaking them, and there was nothing to address other than to have a talk with him about how his words can be misinterpreted and require mandatory sexual harassment training as part of the grad school orientation program for this college. 

When the grad director for sat down with me to go over the report, he want nearly as supportive. Quite the opposite. When the topic of the sexual harassment training came up, the way he introduced it to me was ""now, because of you, we had to add an extra hour to the orientation program.""

12/8/2017 6:26:51,"In 1979 when I was a sophomore in college a professor invited me to his office hours because I was supposedly struggling in a course.  (However, when I would compare my exam and assignment answers to my male peers when we would study together for the next exam or try to figure out the next assignment, I discovered that they earned As and I got Ds or Fs.  Our work was nearly identical and the answers the same;  this really confused me.).  

When I arrived in his office he motioned to a couch and asked me to sit down.  I thought he would sit in the chair at his desk.  He closed the door, locked it, and came and sat beside me.  He told me that he knew I was a ""smart girl"" and that I should not be earning a D.  He said that I could take care of the grade ""right now"" if I wanted to.  I asked if he meant by redoing assignments or retaking exams.  He said, ""No, by doing things with me in the office right now.  The door is locked and no one will ever know.""  I said, ""I don't know what kind of person you think I am, but I'll take the D.""  

I then immediately went to my major adviser, and told him what happened.  I said I wanted to file a complaint.  He told me not to do it because I was going to be abroad the entirety of the following year and he was afraid that if I filed a complaint that the school would try to block me from going.  He said that I needed to trust him but the situation would be taken care of by the time I got back.  He also said that he didn't want to see me get ""blamed"" as a victim or to have my reputation tarnished as I would be dragged through the mud.  I was very upset but trusted him.  I went abroad.  

While I was away a friend wrote to me and told me that the professor who had propositioned me had been fired because two female students had brought him up on contributing to the delinquency of a minor and sexual assault charges.  I'm thankful for those two women and think of them often.  They were brave.  I have no idea who they were.  Now, I think I was a coward.  I also wonder if my major professor did the right thing by advising me not to file a complaint.  However, had I not gone abroad I don't think I would have been as well positioned for graduate school, nor would I have had a series of experiences that led me to choose the professoriate as a career.  

My resentment, however, is that I was many years later told by a professor at my undergraduate institution that the D on my transcript knocked me out of contention for Phi Beta Kappa despite the fact that I had a higher GPA than most of the other students who were inducted during my senior year.  He had been a part of the deliberations, which were very contentious and made my case memorable because normally the committee saw eye-to-eye.

During this meeting my administrator declined to serve as my advocate, taking on the role of a silent note taker. Retaliation ensued and after three years of stellar performance reviews, it became clear to me that the professor wanted me gone and could do serious harm to my livelihood. I had a large family to support and was just starting my career after raising my young children. Suddenly, everything I did was wrong and my performance was critiqued as inferior. I obtained a position on another campus at the same institution without references from my employer (the professor) or my supervisor (the administrator). I was simply lucky-this was virtually unheard of at my institution at the time.","None. When I left the position, having secured a promotion on another campus at the same institution, my administrator let me know that this professor had ""a stack"" of similar grievances against him that has never been acted upon by HR at the institution.

12/8/2017 11:27:09,"June 2010 - At Workshop wrap party at offender's home.

While about half of party was in another room listening to someone play guitar, Prof. __  approached me while I was perusing his library and started up a discussion. There were other people around, but not involved in our conversation. He asked me if I was married for the second time that night (I am), then asked if I have children (I do, and I had brought my still-nursing baby with me to the conference, but she wasn't at the party).  I answered affirmatively to  both, and out of nowhere, he put his hand under my chin and leaned in to try to kiss me.  I immediately pulled away, shocked, and he grinned, then asked, ""Oh, was that not okay?"" I replied, ""no, it is most definitely not okay.""  I was flustered and embarrassed, and continued talking to him so as not to call attention to myself. Then he said he had ""something else to show me upstairs.""  I declined the offer and asked him to bring the book downstairs. 
He insisted, and went upstairs, telling me to follow. Instead, I looked for help. My advisor had left, but female Prof. who is a good friend of advisor and who I'd met for the first time at the workshop was still there. I asked her to come and look at  the films Prof. ___ had been showing me so I could ask her opinion of how to try to deflect/distract him.  From upstairs, we could hear Prof. ___  calling my name and saying that he had found what he was looking for and that I should come upstairs. I responded loudly from the staircase that I was with female Prof. and that he should bring whatever he had back downstairs, but he persisted. Even more embarrassed, and now sure that people could hear him, Female Prof. and I went upstairs together to find him in bed under the covers with his shirt off. Female Prof. shouted, ""We told you you couldn't do this anymore!"" Prof. ___, shocked, mumbled incoherently. I fled downstairs and found a senior student from my university, now a professor at a nearby elite university, and asked for her help and advice. She called a cab for me and told me to contact advisor immediately. 

Prof. _____ tries to approach me at any discipline event I attend, even though I have repeatedly told him I do not want him to talk to me. Most recently, he cornered me after 3 days of my successfully dodging him during conference in order to act chummy and force me to accept a copy of his most recent book. I repeatedly declined until it was starting to become a scene, then told him that it was clear he wasn't listening to me, didn't respect my wishes, and was going to do whatever he felt like, and I had no choice. I told him I would take it, but that I would immediately throw it away. He smiled, pulled it out of his LV bag along with a sharpie and asked, ""should I sign it for you?"" I said I didn't care. He was obviously going to do whatever he wanted. He signed it in the language of our area study, using the most familiar grammatical form to address me. A grammatical slap in the face. Another new acquaintance female Prof., to whom I told my story, expressed sympathy, but then indignation that she, as a friend of Prof. ___ had not been offered the book. She asked if she could have it. I told her that maybe he only gave his books to students he'd harassed and that she could take it out of the trash if she wanted it that badly. She did.

12/8/2017 13:58:29,"When I was a first year graduate student, I started dating another student in my department who was a year ahead of me. The emotional abuse started early; assuming that I could not handle the problem sets on my own, he gave me all of his from the previous year. He constantly invalidated my feelings, suggesting each time I got upset that ""that's such a rich white girl thing to get upset over."" When I made comments during conversations, both one-on-one and in larger groups of physics grad students, he would frequently invalidate me, suggesting that I had seen nothing of the real world, and that I was nothing more than a wealthy sheltered child. 

Over time, he became increasingly controlling, and I feared retaliation when I wanted to end the relationship. I remained in that state for three and a half months. When I finally did, serious harassment ensued. He would drive by my house repeatedly, wait at the end of the bike path where he knew I liked to ride, and occasionally sit on my front steps and wait for me to get home at the end of the day. One day, he chased me out of the gym and screamed at me on the athletic quad. During departmental coffee hours and other social events, he would glare at me, shifting his position to maintain his line of sight. He texted me a death threat, and spread rumors in the department that I cheated on my problem sets and exams. He also circulated the rumor that I was only accepted into the program because of my gender identity, and that I only passed the first year because I am pretty. When I told my close friends about the harassment, many abandoned me, saying that it was my fault for breaking his heart. 

Since there were virtually no female faculty members in my department, and certainly none with whom I had ever conversed, I went to the administrative coordinator. She put me in touch with the Title IX office. The possible paths forward included an on campus no-contact order (which would not protect me in my off campus residence or neighborhood), or a full on restraining order. The Title IX office suggested that if I feared further retaliation, I should not press charges. I was extremely fearful of retaliation. For the remainder my my second year, I only went to campus to attend class. I would arrive five minutes late to the class that we were both enrolled in, and left five minutes early to avoid possible interaction. For the rest of the time, I worked from home.

A fellow graduate student was working in the department's main research center (a title VI funded area studies center). He was always an arrogant, somewhat unpleasant, self-righteous type (and evangelical Christian no less, relevant because of the hypocrisy). One day the (female) director entered the center, a space always open to the public and students (both undergrad and grad), not at all a private office, and there was the grad student in question, on the clock supposed to be working, but instead masturbating to porn right there at his work computer in a public university office. The box of tissues he was careful to keep by the computer took on a whole new connotation, as did the crusty stains on the chair that other grad students were forced to sit in as well as they worked their shifts in the center. The director then found that the computer was filled with porn; it seemed that this is what he did for most of his 'working' hours. He was dismissed from his work-study job in the center BUT that's absolutely all that happened. No other form of rebuke or consequences at all. He continued in the program, continued to work with undergraduates, continued in his seminars with all of us, while several of his fellow graduate students continued to have to sit in the weirdly stained chair he left behind in the center. He took the rebuke so lightly, had so little shame, that he asked for his job back at the center the next year, apparently thinking that his perpetual masturbation in a public university office while on the clock really wasn't such a big deal. They didn't give him the job back, but that's the extent of negative consequence. He graduated and now holds a tenure track position at a different university. I see him at conferences regularly and often wonder, how does he interact with his undergraduates? And how is it that none of us thought to question whether this was a person who should be in a position of power vis-a-vis young vulnerable women? Or, rather, of course we questioned, but it never once occurred to us that we could do anything about it. After all, the administration knew already and did all but nothing. The fact that I'm still questioning, was this harassment?

I had no sexual or romantic interest in him and I made that clear by verbally telling him so at one point in the evening when I felt he crossed a line when he stated that he and I both seemed to have unmet needs. He backed off immediately so I let it go, especially since I believe he had been intoxicated at the time. I am not one to hold a grudge so we became Facebook friends, and that friendship stayed well within what I felt were appropriate boundaries: no more unwelcome advances from him, just mundane liking and commenting on each other's posts, and some good-natured trash talk about sports. Then a few months later our Dean asked me to take on additional responsibilities regarding program level assessment within the college, since that is an interest of mine. In addition to having me advise [the dean] on assessment related matters, she also made me available to the chairs of all the departments in the college so that they could consult with me on implementing best practices for assessing student learning outcomes in their respective programs. The individual in question sent me a private Facebook message telling me that the dean ""gave"" me to him and said that that I have to do whatever he said, and he then suggested that we meet up at the airport Holiday Inn every Friday night to ""talk assessment."" This disturbed me quite a bit, but because I didn't want to make waves I chose to pretend I didn't understand his implication and answered him in earnest that I would be willing to meet in the library with other staff members to talk about assessing his program.

12/8/2017 22:02:39,"About 20 years ago I was assaulted in a car and asked if I wanted to have sex by a college professor I was taking a summer workshop with. He actually grabbed my pussy, trite as that sounds now. We were alone together, on a professional errand outside the institution. I was a student paying to be in his class and making great personal sacrifice to be there at all, and I assumed everything about the situation was strictly professional. He must have thought my interest in joining the errand was a come-on? I said no and he left me alone. 2 days later, another young female student approached me with her own report of his inappropriate behavior. The next day another young female student confided in us that she was returning the teacher's interest in her. Student #2 and I reported what was happening to the administration. I had never bonded so intensely and so quickly with another co-student as I did that week. He knew we were on to him and ridiculed us in front of the other students when he could for the rest of the workshop.
","An early-20's student, between undergrad and grad school",Professor at a small private college,Other Type of School,,Arts,,"I and another student together reported to the school administration our experiences of being harassed  almost immediately after they occurred. We also explained what was going on with the professor and our other friend and how toxic the learning environment was by then-- just 3 days into a weeklong workshop. We were told to make sure we wrote our thoughts down on the class evaluations, and that was it. So we then told our teaching assistant, as she also worked full-time as a colleague with him at their home institution. Her reply was that because she hadn't seen any harrassment happening, she couldn't do anything about it.","Can't say for sure. Previously, it seemed this teacher taught regular summer workshops (every 2-3 years) at this school. After this occurred and we reported it, he wasn't asked back to teach there for another 10 years. I know this because he made the point to gloat to me about it. I have reported the harrassment I experienced twice to my institution (where we both teach now) and the first time the administration just seemed relieved that I was aware of the predator in my department. The second time I reported this I also was addressing his bullying and retaliation, and HR told me there was no retaliation, to not talk with anyone about this, and they did not investigate the report I filed about the original sexual harrassment incident.","It's complicated. Ironically, a few years after this occurred, I began working with him directly as a colleague. Then a few years into that teaching job I was promoted and I became his supervisor. Then a few years later, he began bullying me. The bullying began at about the same time I fully realized he had no sway on my career and never really did. The toxicity of his predatory behavior is widely known in the field and many, many people have taken me aside to speak about it. Some were worried about me and wanted to warn me, others told me they were hesitant to work with me because I work with him and he causes trouble. and others criticized what they perceived to be as my ""loyalty"" to him during my first few years of teaching.","I work in an environment that ebbs and flows with toxicity and feel betrayed on multiple levels by my institution. There are many good days, days when my only concern is my classroom and obligations to the magic that is there. This is what I cherish and focus on in my work. And there have been some bad days, days when I don't know what to say and cannot believe I'm still dealing with his shit.","In some ways this situation has been a gift. I understand now how our culture is changing from within each of us--- 15 years ago I told another colleague I would kick ass if anyone came to me with a complaint about this former teacher and now-colleague. Now I realize that for many years I was overlooked my own complaint and didn't value or expect anyone else to value the awful experience I had already had with this teacher.

12/9/2017 8:05:49,"I was an assistant professor and had organized a discussion and exhibition around a new arts publication in an off-campus gallery operated by some alumni of my program. Very few of my colleagues came, but the banana-incising senior colleague (reference to my previous post) did. During the course of the discussion, he said, apparently out of the blue, ""I am guided in everything I do by the breasts of [name of mutual female student, also present.]"" The room had a spasm of discomfort as everyone looked to the student he had named. She initiated some anxious laughter and I tried to steer the discussion back on track. A couple of days later, I spoke to the student who minimized the comment. It apparently was a reference to a performance artwork that she had recently made 
in his class, but it was not in any way germane to the discussion. I pointed out that I had a legal obligation to report harassment and that his bringing up her breasts publicly, without the context of the performance, was inappropriate and could have a chilling effect on female students. She was adamant that did not want to pursue a complaint. I sought the counsel of my faculty mentor, who was furious and told me she was going to report it. She wanted to keep me out of it because the senior colleague had a reputation of retaliation. An investigation ensued, which the senior professor easily traced back to me because I was the only colleague present and the only one who had a responsibility to report his inappropriate comment. The senior colleague then proceeded to place ads in the alternative arts newsweekly in which he used hand-drawn comics to explain away his behavior and portray me as a worthless artist in league with the nefarious administration to end free speech and free artistic expression.  The student whose breasts had been discussed publicly did not want to participate in the investigation, and the investigation became politicized, as the department administration was pushing very hard to paint him as unstable to get rid of a professor who had long been a thorn in their side. I was not involved in any of this, but it's my analysis from afar. Eventually, this strategy backfired, and my senior colleague was cleared of the harassment charges. He celebrated his exoneration with a Facebook post calling me and the chair of the department out by name for our unsuccessful attempt to destroy him. A couple of years later the student whose breasts he had discussed publicly told me that he had pursued and harassed her after graduation and that she wishes she had pursued the investigation.

I enjoyed his teaching, he said he was impressed by my intellect, and we kept in touch via online chat after the program ended. He also offered to write me a letter of recommendation.

At one point he asked to call me on the phone, then during the call described the size of his penis and talked about it growing erect, asked me if the description made me aroused, and asked me to talk dirty to him. He also asked whether he could visit me after I went to college; I politely deflected that.
We stopped talking a little while after that, which was a huge relief for me.

12/10/2017 8:46:24,"When I was a PhD student in a science field, I was working many hours per day (as many as 16) as a construction contractor.  I realized that a smarter way to pay for my education habit would be to be a faculty member.  I was told about an employment opportunity in the university in which I was a student.  I went to an office to speak with the Secretary to the Director.  She scheduled an appointment with the Director.  

I arrived for that appointment, sat across the desk from the Director, and noticed a ""Post-it Note"" (signed by the Secretary) on the Director's desk.  Reading the note upside down, I discovered that (in Spanish) it said, "" ________ __________ 01:00 p.m.  Hire him.  He is a stud.""  The Director was ~ 31 years young.  I was ~ 26 years young.  She scheduled an interview with a committee (but, told me that the job was mine.  Nobody else would be interviewed).  

After I had been hired, she told me that my first day on the job would be spent flying to San Luis Obispo to participate in a conference.  When we arrived and were carrying our bags into the hotel, she told me that I did not need to occupy a separate room.  Oh yes I did!!!!!!!  That comment certainly made me uncomfortable.  

As the weeks of the job went on, she would introduce me to other women telling 
them that she had hired me because of that note from the Secretary.  If I had been pale-skinned, I know that one could have seen that I was blushing.  Those comments certainly did make me uncomfortable.  

When I arrived in that major research university (during the 1970s), I was told by male faculty members and by male students that the unwritten rules of dating were such that; when a man took a woman on a date and paid for a meal in a nice restaurant, the woman reciprocated by inviting him into her body.  I never, ever would consider such disrespectful behavior.  However, my boss consistently would tell me.  ""Your taking me to dinner.""  I would take her to ""Taco Time"" and pay for her meal.  No matter how flirtatious she was, I would not respond in any unprofessional way.  I did not want any relationship with her other than our professional one as administrative, student-services faculty members in the same program.

I was invited to apply for a faculty position in another institution of higher education (which desperately needed somebody who could teach Mathematics in Spanish and in English).  I did not remain two years in that first uncomfortable job.  I probably was helped (in dealing with the boss who wanted me for my body) by being married to the most beautiful woman in the world.    

Those many experiences with that person did not give me any PTSD.  I did not lose sleep because of them.  I did not report them to any university administrators in levels of more authority.  

I finished a B. Sci., M. Sci., and Ph.D. without ever accepting one penny of financial aid, scholarship funds, fellowship funds, student loans, etc.  I finished with no debt.

I am one of only 3 females in the 18 person workshop and the other two work in much more classically male-gendered areas. I am also 1 of 2 graduate students involved; everyone else has at least one award-winning book out. The group went out for dinner the night before the conference. Drinks were had; I am an outgoing person and had a lot of fun chatting with those around me. One person from the gendered-male framing field I had never met before or read any of his work. We got along really well and when he mentioned that his daughter was a year younger than me I felt assured that nothing creepy was going on. 

The next day at lunch, he again sits next to me and asks me if I want to go out to a sports event after the conference concludes the next day; because he is one of the conference organizers, he knows my flight leaves the next morning and I am spending another night in town. I start to get wigged out by how he is isolating me from the group, and the fact that he seems to not want anyone else to hear this invitation, so I blow him off saying I think I need to be conducting research in the local archives, I need to check  the holdings, etc. The next day, the final day of the conference he asked me over breakfast again about accompanying him to the sporting event and this time I firmly declined and just said I couldn't. He ignored me all day and except to be dismissive of my paper while everyone else was positive/constructive.

12/10/2017 11:16:05,"I was working in a research lab in 2004 for a tenured professor--an older male and a self-proclaimed ""maverick"" and ""well-respected pioneer"" in his field. I also came to learn quickly that he was temperamental, verbally abusive to others in the lab, and prone to outbursts. The morning of the lab's holiday party, he threw one of his legendary verbal tantrums, and I happened to be the target. I was furious. That afternoon at the party, still enraged, I simply ignored him. I refused to engage with him or even look in his direction. But I could see in my peripheral vision that he kept looking across the crowded room over in my direction, trying to catch my eye. I continued to stare straight ahead. He walked toward me in my direction and I continued to stare straight ahead. And then walked behind me, slowly dragging his knuckles across my backside as he passed. He said nothing.  All these years I've been embarrassed that I did nothing in response -- I didn't call him out on it, I didn't report it, I told no one at the time, for fear I would lose my job, my health insurance, and prospects for future jobs.

When he saw me with my advisor, he would remark on us being together and how close we were; he didn't outright come out and say it, but it was obvious by his tone of voice and body language what he was insinuating. My advisor and I mostly laughed it off. But a few weeks later, I saw the other professor walking past my apartment as my (also gay) male boss was dropping off a 'duty'/on call phone (I worked for the university) at my front door one morning. The other professor later cornered me at the campus center when I was getting food and asked who the guy at my front door had been. I sort of awkwardly responded that he was my boss and started to explain that he was dropping off a phone for work when he interrupted me and said, ""so he's *also* someone you work for?""

12/10/2017 14:33:54,"The Director and the Executive Director of the research unit I worked in created a terribly sexist and toxic work environment. The first thing the Director said to my co-worker and I (we were both new hires) when we met him was ""Nobody's pregnant right? You're not pregnant?"" We shook our heads ""No"" and he said ""Good. I don't need anybody else getting pregnant."" His assistant in his home department had just had a baby, and he made frequent remarks like this. He was not often around, but during meetings he would make sexist jokes or jokes about feminism/feminists. His relationship with the ED made everyone uncomfortable (from the way they behaved together to what she did on company time for him--including making personal appointments for him, buying him gifts, cleaning his personal home on work time, etc.). The way he talked to some of the women and a student worker made us uncomfortable. He and the ED were always together when he was in the office and she was the gatekeeper to any interaction with him. Backstage during a public event, myself, colleagues, and several volunteers saw her kiss him and call him ""Papa."" Another colleague whose job duties required her to be in close contact during events mentioned that he was very handsy with the ED and would often touch her butt. People in other departments expressed concern to me about the nature of their relationship. One asked me, ""Is she a starfucker?"" I hadn't even initiated the conversation, but people offered up their thoughts. Donors referred to us, an all woman staff, as the ""[Director's name] Girls."" It was embarrassing and demeaning. I had issues with my direct manager that I frequently had to address with the ED, but when I brought my concerns up she chuckled and brushed it off saying, ""Well, we are an office full of women."" This is someone who had previously been in leadership roles with university women's programs. I was also verbally chastised whenever I put any of my work concerns in e-mail or any other trackable form, which made it harder to address issues because she was never in the office to speak with. She was allowed to do whatever and come and go as she pleased, often staying unresponsive so long that everything became one ongoing fire to manage. I was usually vocal about this -- even speaking to the Director about it. As a result, I was marked off on my performance evaluation for ""having a tendency to air my grievances to the group,"" and my direct manager accused me of creating a toxic work environment (even though all the staff had the same issues with the leadership team).  My direct manager--who had just openly accused me of toxicity--then held a private meeting with me, asked me to promise not to tell anyone what she was about to say to me, and told me she also had issues with what was happening there and that I should definitely go to HR. ""Promise me you won't tell anyone about this meeting,"" she said. The amount of gaslighting was unreal at this place!

I also didn't have much hard evidence to give because I was specifically told not to put these things in e-mails by the ED. I had a Dean approach me early on in my employment at one of the events and say, ""Is it as bad to work here as I've heard?"" I said, ""Yes,"" but I never saw anyone do anything to help. The Director is a high profile professor who is still highly regarded at the university as far as I can tell. HR finally reached out to one of my remaining colleagues on their own because of the high rate of turnover and talked with her privately. I mentioned to her that myself and another colleague would be willing to talk to them since we were still at the university.

I still have existing, mutual professional relationships with some of these people that I still have to manage, and it is difficult.

","It has left me with a much more negative/pessimistic view of the university as a whole, and it has segregated out some of my career options at ASU because I will never apply for a job that works adjacently with them for fear of having to work with them again in some capacity.

12/10/2017 18:10:20,"My grad program (late nineties, early 2000's) had a culture of constantly accusing people of having affairs. WIth the possible exception of undergrads, people at all ranks participated, including support staff. Sometimes these accusations were within the bounds of moral condemnation, I.e., people claimed to have uncovered abuse of a subordinate, but often they were just a sort of malicious slash fiction, with political allies or even people who worked in similar areas accused of having sex with one another, with their grad students, with their famous dissertation directors, etc. It was never clear to me as a student what sparked a particular story; after a while, one simply expected a new one every semester. As I think on it I realize that the accusations always hit those who could conceivably move on from the department--successful grads, junior fac, and the few minor stars among associate and fulls--never the deadwood, and never the rooted locals among students. So it was a kind of accusation of treason or disloyalty, really: how dare you desire more than this.  

The situation was particularly grim because the city was small, and many faculty and grad students lived and drank in a particular neighborhood only about three-quarters of a mile in diameter; one was literally surveilled in one's private life. This gossip was spread in person, in e-mails, and I have heard reports that there were (implicitly homophobic) allegations against a man (associate prof) in the men's room, as a graffito that was not removed for a long time. At least one person who was a target of what I knew to be false (and again homophobic) rumors spread similar rumors about a colleague, in apparent good faith, and rather carelessly, as an item of mild entertainment. I think perhaps they were not aware of the comparatively more vicious accusations that had been leveled against them, and did not perceive a broader culture of abuse-by-slander. We all lost our moral bearings utterly, I think. 

Eventually, I was accused of sleeping with my director, or rather...not accused directly but suddenly treated as an object of ridicule, with the obvious inference being continually re-drawn. There was zero basis for the rumor other than the fact that we had a congenial relationship, but there were many occasions when I was suddenly asked loaded questions by smirking people I didn't know well, and one memorable incident when I waved hi to some acquaintances (an ABD woman and a full professor man) at an MLA, only to have them pause, glance at eachother, laugh loudly and incredulously in my face, and walk away. 
;
The worst part is, even while being aghast at my own mistreatment, I didn't question many of the rumors I heard about others; I merely congratulated myself on a relative lack of prudishness, or occasionally felt superior because I had good evidence that a particular story was false. Since the ones I knew were false were also the ones that would have been serious abuses of power (involving students), I was complacent. Today, I recognize someone that I believed false stories about in this spreadsheet, and I feel terrible for not being more careful about what I accepted and did not accept as true. I don't think I ever met or spoke to that person except in passing, but I offer her my apologies nonetheless. It seems obvious that her career was profoundly damaged by this situation, and while I couldn't have prevented that, I could have substituted empathy for facile cynicism.

The diffuseness of the offenses--which came from everyone and no one, and which were often cloaked in facile feminism, an acceptably mild homophobia, and cheap moralism--militated against even articulating it as a problem, much less finding an institutional solution. I think that this sort of culture, which I have since encountered in a slightly different form elsewhere, is under-recognized as a form of gendered oppression, because no one harm can be attributed to any one actor, and the abuse itself does not follow gender binaries. Men can be attacked, and women can be attackers, and attackers can be attacked. BUt it is always women and queer people who suffer the worst consequences. That's whose reputation does not recover, and that's who (in my experience) feels worst about it.  ","Department imploded catastrophically through general mismanagement and contentiousness, and not directly because of the rumors (though they certainly contributed to the mistrust). Many people who were subject to false rumors have since left the department, either by graduation or changing jobs. Those individuals who only accused others, without ever being accused themselves, have suffered no harms that I know of.","The rumor that I had had sex with my advisor was personally devastating around the time of my graduation and across the next 2-3 years, both because it implied general, public doubt of my capacities, and because it besmirched a good relationship that I was and am grateful for.

The second professor responded, ""Don't worry, she'll be okay. My Mom had breast cancer and she's boobless now. It'll all work out."" I found out days later that they had granted an exception to a male student to have the exam emailed to them as they would be out of the country the day it was scheduled. Days after the exam, I received an email from them wishing my Mother well without actually apologizing for what was said. After a year of repeatedly being told I wasn't good enough to stay in the course sequence , I abandoned working with those faculty and turned my work in a different direction.

This pressure continued for months despite my repeated declarations that I was not interested. Unfortunately, despite my best judgment, I eventually gave in and started dating him. It quickly became evident that this was not a relationship that would work for me. He was emotionally abusive and unbearably narcissistic. I tried to break it off with him multiple times, but each time he made life at work a living hell, and eventually I would succumb to his advances just to quell the non-stop barrage of verbal and emotional abuse (although obviously it was still abuse to be coerced into a relationship like this). When I finally ended it for the last time, he of course made my life a living hell again at work...as I had feared. This was a problem because he was specializing in an analytical technique I needed for my research project and he was supposed to be mentoring me for that component of my research. But it wasn't just that he refused to help me. He took it a step further and was a cruel bully to me in the workplace. For example, he regularly told me I wasn't smart enough for the program. Any time I had a question, any time I made a small mistake, sometimes out of the blue for no reason at all. He would remind me of my inferiority. He even went as far as to spread horrible rumors about me to other graduate students in our program. Some of the rumors were sexual in nature. Others were about my ""incompetence"" in our field. These rumors socially isolated me from the rest of the group. ",Ph.D. student,more senior Ph.D. student,Other R1,,Engineering,,"It had been months after I ended the relationship and he was still making my life hell. I told him one day that he could not treat me like this. He responded that there was nothing I could do about it. Something in me just snapped and I decided it was time to tell someone. I had not told anyone before because I was apprehensive about being perceived as ""a silly girl causing drama in the department."" I didn't care anymore. The abuse needed to stop. When I approached our two advisers about the issue, I was told by his adviser that academia is the ""wild, wild west"", essentially I was told to just deal with it and not bother anyone else with this. My adviser agreed to remove me from any project collaborations that included the harasser (at my request). Over a year later, one of the other graduate students who was aware of the issue spoke to the chair of our department. He requested a meeting with me where I described the events that occurred and what the adviser responses had been. The chair expressed sincere apologies to me and assured me he would implement policies to combat this behavior (both from my harasser and the adviser response) in the future. The chair has since created a sexual harassment committee in the department.

This drastically limited the scope of my research from what I had originally intended to do. At the time, it was the only solution I could come up with, and it was at least a short-term solution to get me out of the hostile environment. Thinking back on it now, I should not have been forced to compromise my research just to keep myself safe. My harasser should have been kicked out of the program for his behavior. I ended up doing fine on my own. I published four first-author papers from my PhD research, landed a great postdoc position, and have now been hired as a tenure-track assistant professor at an R1 institution. But this was all much more difficult than it needed to be. ","I nearly quit graduate school. I sat in my car in the parking lot most mornings with tears running down my face while I worked up the will power to go into the lab and face my harasser. This entire experience (from before dating, to abusive relationship, to post-dating hell) lasted over one year. One morning while I was still dating my harasser, I decided to drive away from work with the intention of driving my car off a cliff I knew of ~20 minutes away. I was suicidal. I couldn't see a way out of this mess. My suicide attempt was put on hold by a serendipitous phone call from a close friend. I pulled over and spoke to my friend on the phone for almost an hour, and then headed back into work. This was the incident that led me to finally end the relationship for good. My work environment improved slightly after I was removed from any collaborations with this individual, but it took me years to work through the stress and anxiety of this harassment.","Now that I am an assistant professor at an R1, I am more committed than ever to stop this type of abuse in academia.

(My field is quasi-academic, but I'm independently based, although also pursing a degree in a different subject). After about a year or so of pleasant, occasional, and exclusively collegial acquaintance  (mainly through email or the occasional meeting), I began receiving emails from this older colleague telling me he had 'reviewed my work' and he was 'aggrieved' to tell me that he had found it to be 'horribly inadequate.' There followed an exegesis of several pages attacking some of my previously published work.  The attacks involved very minor details. There were veiled threats if I refused to prove receptive to more of these diatribes. I immediately informed him I was not interested in receiving these 'critiques' and asked him to cease contact altogether. 

A few months later, we were both at the same conference, and he followed around (stalked me).

12/12/2017 4:49:17,"Upon commencing work I became aware that a married colleague in his 60s was openly dating a 20-something Masters student from the department - apparently the latest in a long line of affairs with graduate and undergraduate students, who were gifted with extra resources such as money for conference trips, opportunities to co-write papers and (it was rumoured) great marks. I was shocked by how accepting everyone seemed of this. I spoke to the HoD, asking - are these rumours true? He said they were, but wrung his hands, saying, ""there's nothing we can do."" I was devastated! He said if confronted, the colleague would simply lie, subtly pointing out that the man's wife was head of HR for the whole University. He said - what I will do is move the student out of his office, which they were sharing(!). He got her her own office, and that was meant to be that. I looked up the University's code of ethics governing staff-student relationships and you could drive a truck through it. It turned out he'd written it. I felt sick about it all but couldn't see any action to take, particularly given other colleagues were turning a blind eye. One who worked in feminist philosophy remarked that the students concerned were over the age of consent and she didn't hold with 'seeing women as victims'. A few years later a complaint came in from the high schools where we taught Ethics and guess who was super-keen to go out there and deliver it? The complaint was about inappropriate contact after hours (texting) with a 16 year old girl. I was so upset. The University only investigated after certain people pushed hard from inside. I never found out the results, and the colleague remained in place until he died of alcohol-related illness. 
What I want to comment on re. all this is that given the colleague was employed for over 30 years, how very many female students must have been caught up in the behaviour - and what happened to their educations? (If any are reading this, please consider that you may have been abused, even if you thought it was consensual.) Also, the wife who was head of HR for the whole University knew all about the behaviour, protected him for years, and even today she is still in place. I consider that appalling.

I was TAing for a professor who I had heard awful things about and had avoided working with formally, even though he would have been instrumental to a large part of my research.

At the end of the semester, after the last TA meeting, he asked me (in front of everyone) to stay behind. He closed the door, blocked it with his body, took my hand in his, held it firmly, and went on and on about how he would do anything he could for me, that anything I needed I should ask him for, etc. etc. I saw him at events after this and he ALWAYS made comments about my body. Despite all this, I asked him to sit on my dissertation committee--again, he is a giant in his field.

12/12/2017 17:45:40,"When I was an undergrad (last year) my thesis advisor harassed me for the entire year. It started with compliments and gift-giving and other grooming tactics, then he began sending me romantic emails asking me on dates. Lots of requests for dinner and drinks too. His comments then turned explicitly sexual and he would talk about my body and what I was wearing. He also made very possessive comments about “not sharing me” etc. After rejecting his advanced for quite a while he eventually turned hostile and repeatedly told me I was acting moody and bitchy. All the while, he never helped me with my thesis. Whenever I asked for help he would brush me off and tell me that it “looks great.” I didn’t feel like it was great at all. I was struggling through Aristotle’s Metaphysics alone. My secondary reader recommended that my paper get a C- but he ended up giving me an A anyway (because all year he told me it was great).

I don’t have confidence in any of my academic achievements anymore.,"I was in denial for a very, very long time. I wont be fully able
to accept what happened until I read the report and the professional investigator confirms this experience. I did suffer some anxiety from this issue and my confidence is certainly shattered, but overall I’m grateful for this experience because of how eye-opening it has been. Also, I’m sure my reaction will hinge a lot upon how the College decided to handle this and whether or not justice is served. That will be the most telling part of all of this.","Definitely not pursuing higher ed now in philisophy. Too rigged with harassment and dominated my males.
